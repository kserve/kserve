 *
 * (This is a heavily cut-down "BSD license".)
 *
 * This differs from Colin Plumb's older public domain implementation in that
 * no exactly 32-bit integer data type is required (any 32-bit or wider
 * unsigned integer data type will do), there's no compile-time endianness
 * configuration, and the function prototypes match OpenSSL's. No code from
 * Colin Plumb's implementation has been reused; this comment merely compares
 * the properties of the two independent implementations.
 *
 * The primary goals of this implementation are portability and ease of use.
 * It is meant to be fast, but not as fast as possible. Some known
 * optimizations are not included to reduce source code size and avoid
 * compile-time configuration.
