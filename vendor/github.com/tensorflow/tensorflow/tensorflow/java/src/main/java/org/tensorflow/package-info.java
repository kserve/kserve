/**
 * Defines classes to build, save, load and execute TensorFlow models.
 *
 * <p><b>WARNING</b>: The API is currently experimental and is not covered by TensorFlow <a
 * href="https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/version_semantics">API stability
 * guarantees</a>. See <a
 * href="https://www.tensorflow.org/code/tensorflow/java/README.md">README.md</a> for installation
 * instructions.
 *
 * <p>The <a
 * href="https://www.tensorflow.org/code/tensorflow/java/src/main/java/org/tensorflow/examples/LabelImage.java">LabelImage</a>
 * example demonstrates use of this API to classify images using a pre-trained <a
 * href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00567">Inception</a> architecture convolutional neural network.
 * It demonstrates:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Graph construction: using the OperationBuilder class to construct a graph to decode, resize
 *       and normalize a JPEG image.
 *   <li>Model loading: Using Graph.importGraphDef() to load a pre-trained Inception model.
 *   <li>Graph execution: Using a Session to execute the graphs and find the best label for an
 *       image.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Additional examples can be found in the <a
 * href="https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/samples/languages/java">tensorflow/models</a>
 * GitHub repository.
