# Intended only for use within this directory.
# Generated python wrappers are "private" visibility, users should depend on the
# full python code that incorporates the wrappers.  The generated targets have
# a _gen suffix, so that the full python version can use the bare name.
# We also hard code the hidden_file here to reduce duplication.
#
# We should consider moving the "out" default pattern into here, many other
# consumers of the tf_gen_op_wrapper_py rule would be simplified if we don't
# hard code the ops/ directory.
