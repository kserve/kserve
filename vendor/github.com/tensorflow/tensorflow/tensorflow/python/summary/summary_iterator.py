  """An iterator for reading `Event` protocol buffers from an event file.

  You can use this function to read events written to an event file. It returns
  a Python iterator that yields `Event` protocol buffers.

  Example: Print the contents of an events file.

  ```python
  for e in tf.train.summary_iterator(path to events file):
      print(e)
  ```

  Example: Print selected summary values.

  ```python
  # This example supposes that the events file contains summaries with a
  # summary value tag 'loss'.  These could have been added by calling
  # `add_summary()`, passing the output of a scalar summary op created with
  # with: `tf.summary.scalar('loss', loss_tensor)`.
  for e in tf.train.summary_iterator(path to events file):
      for v in e.summary.value:
          if v.tag == 'loss':
              print(v.simple_value)
  ```

  See the protocol buffer definitions of
  [Event](https://www.tensorflow.org/code/tensorflow/core/util/event.proto)
  and
  [Summary](https://www.tensorflow.org/code/tensorflow/core/framework/summary.proto)
  for more information about their attributes.

  Args:
    path: The path to an event file created by a `SummaryWriter`.

  Yields:
    `Event` protocol buffers.
