  """Base class for general-purpose code transformers transformers.

  This is an extension of ast.NodeTransformer that provides a few additional
  functions, like state tracking within the scope of arbitrary node, helpers
  for processing code blocks, debugging, mapping of transformed code to
  original code, and others.

  Scope-local state tracking: to keep state across nodes, at the level of
  (possibly nested) scopes, use enter/exit_local_scope and set/get_local.
  You must call enter/exit_local_scope manually, but the transformer detects
  when they are not properly paired.

  The transformer allows keeping state across calls to visit_* that is local to
  arbitrary nodes and their descendants, using the self.state attribute.
  Multiple independent scopes are allowed and automatically constructed.

  For example, to keep track of the If node that encloses any Name node, one can
  write:

    class FooType(object):

      def __init__(self):
        self.foo_property = None

    class DummyTransformer(Base):

    An example of a block is the body of an if statement.

    destination. This is done by after_visit by returning a non-null
    second return value, e.g. return new_node, new_destination.
