  """Computes log Poisson loss given `log_input`.

  Gives the log-likelihood loss between the prediction and the target under the
  assumption that the target has a Poisson distribution.
  Caveat: By default, this is not the exact loss, but the loss minus a
    constant term [log(z!)]. That has no effect for optimization, but
    does not play well with relative loss comparisons. To compute an
    approximation of the log factorial term, specify
    compute_full_loss=True to enable Stirling's Approximation.

  For brevity, let `c = log(x) = log_input`, `z = targets`.  The log Poisson
  loss is

        -log(exp(-x) * (x^z) / z!)
      = -log(exp(-x) * (x^z)) + log(z!)
      ~ -log(exp(-x)) - log(x^z) [+ z * log(z) - z + 0.5 * log(2 * pi * z)]
          [ Note the second term is the Stirling's Approximation for log(z!).
            It is invariant to x and does not affect optimization, though
            important for correct relative loss comparisons. It is only

  Measures the probability error in discrete classification tasks in which each
  class is independent and not mutually exclusive.  For instance, one could
  perform multilabel classification where a picture can contain both an elephant
  and a dog at the same time.

  For brevity, let `x = logits`, `z = labels`.  The logistic loss is

def weighted_cross_entropy_with_logits(targets, logits, pos_weight, name=None):
  """Computes a weighted cross entropy.

  This is like `sigmoid_cross_entropy_with_logits()` except that `pos_weight`,
  allows one to trade off recall and precision by up- or down-weighting the
  cost of a positive error relative to a negative error.

  The usual cross-entropy cost is defined as:

      targets * -log(sigmoid(logits)) +
          (1 - targets) * -log(1 - sigmoid(logits))

  A value `pos_weights > 1` decreases the false negative count, hence increasing
  the recall.
  Conversely setting `pos_weights < 1` decreases the false positive count and
  increases the precision.
  This can be seen from the fact that `pos_weight` is introduced as a
  multiplicative coefficient for the positive targets term
  in the loss expression:

      targets * -log(sigmoid(logits)) * pos_weight +
          (1 - targets) * -log(1 - sigmoid(logits))

  For brevity, let `x = logits`, `z = targets`, `q = pos_weight`.

    * In the common case where the 'depth' dimension is the last dimension in
      the input tensor `x`, they may be one dimensional tensors of the same
      size as the 'depth' dimension.
      This is the case for example for the common `[batch, depth]` layout of
      fully-connected layers, and `[batch, height, width, depth]` for
      convolutions.
      `mean` and `variance` in this case would typically be the outputs of
      `tf.nn.moments(..., keep_dims=False)` during training, or running averages
      thereof during inference.

    x: Input `Tensor` of arbitrary dimensionality.
    mean: A mean `Tensor`.
    variance: A variance `Tensor`.
    offset: An offset `Tensor`, often denoted \\(\beta\\) in equations, or
      None. If present, will be added to the normalized tensor.
    scale: A scale `Tensor`, often denoted \\(\gamma\\) in equations, or
      `None`. If present, the scale is applied to the normalized tensor.
    variance_epsilon: A small float number to avoid dividing by 0.
    name: A name for this operation (optional).

  Returns:

  See [Noise-contrastive estimation: A new estimation principle for

  Also see our [Candidate Sampling Algorithms
  Reference](https://www.tensorflow.org/extras/candidate_sampling.pdf)

  A common use case is to use this method for training, and calculate the full
  sigmoid loss for evaluation or inference as in the following example:

  ```python
  if mode == "train":
    loss = tf.nn.nce_loss(
        weights=weights,
        biases=biases,
        labels=labels,
        inputs=inputs,
        ...)
  elif mode == "eval":
    logits = tf.matmul(inputs, tf.transpose(weights))
    logits = tf.nn.bias_add(logits, biases)
    labels_one_hot = tf.one_hot(labels, n_classes)
    loss = tf.nn.sigmoid_cross_entropy_with_logits(
        labels=labels_one_hot,
        logits=logits)
    loss = tf.reduce_sum(loss, axis=1)
  ```

  Note: when doing embedding lookup on `weights` and `bias`, "div" partition
  strategy will be used. Support for other partition strategy will be added
  later.

  Note: By default this uses a log-uniform (Zipfian) distribution for sampling,
  so your labels must be sorted in order of decreasing frequency to achieve
  good results.  For more details, see
  `tf.nn.log_uniform_candidate_sampler`.

  Note: In the case where `num_true` > 1, we assign to each target class
  the target probability 1 / `num_true` so that the target probabilities
  sum to 1 per-example.

  Note: It would be useful to allow a variable number of target classes per
  example.  We hope to provide this functionality in a future release.
  For now, if you have a variable number of target classes, you can pad them
  out to a constant number by either repeating them or by padding
  with an otherwise unused class.

  A common use case is to use this method for training, and calculate the full
  sigmoid loss for evaluation or inference. In this case, you must set
  `partition_strategy="div"` for the two losses to be consistent, as in the
  following example:

  ```python
  if mode == "train":
    loss = tf.nn.nce_loss(
        weights=weights,
        biases=biases,
        labels=labels,
        inputs=inputs,
        ...,
        partition_strategy="div")
  elif mode == "eval":
    logits = tf.matmul(inputs, tf.transpose(weights))
    logits = tf.nn.bias_add(logits, biases)
    labels_one_hot = tf.one_hot(labels, n_classes)
    loss = tf.nn.sigmoid_cross_entropy_with_logits(
        labels=labels_one_hot,
        logits=logits)
    loss = tf.reduce_sum(loss, axis=1)
  ```

  Note: By default this uses a log-uniform (Zipfian) distribution for sampling,
  so your labels must be sorted in order of decreasing frequency to achieve
  good results.  For more details, see
  `tf.nn.log_uniform_candidate_sampler`.

  Note: In the case where `num_true` > 1, we assign to each target class
  the target probability 1 / `num_true` so that the target probabilities
  sum to 1 per-example.

  Note: It would be useful to allow a variable number of target classes per
  example.  We hope to provide this functionality in a future release.
  For now, if you have a variable number of target classes, you can pad them
  out to a constant number by either repeating them or by padding
  with an otherwise unused class.
