  The moving average of 'variable' updated with 'value' is:

  The returned Operation sets 'variable' to the newly computed moving average,

     variable -= (1 - decay) * (variable - value)

  `zero_debias` optionally enables scaling by the mathematically correct
  debiasing factor of
    1 - decay ** num_updates

class ExponentialMovingAverage(object):
  """Maintains moving averages of variables by employing an exponential decay.

  When training a model, it is often beneficial to maintain moving averages of
  the trained parameters.  Evaluations that use averaged parameters sometimes
  produce significantly better results than the final trained values.

  The `apply()` method adds shadow copies of trained variables and add ops that
  maintain a moving average of the trained variables in their shadow copies.
  It is used when building the training model.  The ops that maintain moving
  averages are typically run after each training step.
  The `average()` and `average_name()` methods give access to the shadow
  variables and their names.  They are useful when building an evaluation
  model, or when restoring a model from a checkpoint file.  They help use the
  moving averages in place of the last trained values for evaluations.

  The moving averages are computed using exponential decay.  You specify the
  decay value when creating the `ExponentialMovingAverage` object.  The shadow
  variables are initialized with the same initial values as the trained
  variables.  When you run the ops to maintain the moving averages, each
  shadow variable is updated with the formula:

    `shadow_variable -= (1 - decay) * (shadow_variable - variable)`

  This is mathematically equivalent to the classic formula below, but the use
  of an `assign_sub` op (the `"-="` in the formula) allows concurrent lockless
  updates to the variables:

    `shadow_variable = decay * shadow_variable + (1 - decay) * variable`

  Reasonable values for `decay` are close to 1.0, typically in the
  multiple-nines range: 0.999, 0.9999, etc.

  Example usage when creating a training model:

  ```python
  # Create variables.
  var0 = tf.Variable(...)
  var1 = tf.Variable(...)
  # ... use the variables to build a training model...
  ...
  # Create an op that applies the optimizer.  This is what we usually
  # would use as a training op.
  opt_op = opt.minimize(my_loss, [var0, var1])

  # Create an ExponentialMovingAverage object
  ema = tf.train.ExponentialMovingAverage(decay=0.9999)

  with tf.control_dependencies([opt_op]):
      # Create the shadow variables, and add ops to maintain moving averages
      # of var0 and var1. This also creates an op that will update the moving
      # averages after each training step.  This is what we will use in place
      # of the usual training op.
      training_op = ema.apply([var0, var1])

  ...train the model by running training_op...
  ```

  There are two ways to use the moving averages for evaluations:

  *  Build a model that uses the shadow variables instead of the variables.
     For this, use the `average()` method which returns the shadow variable
     for a given variable.
  *  Build a model normally but load the checkpoint files to evaluate by using
     the shadow variable names.  For this use the `average_name()` method.  See
     the `tf.train.Saver` for more
     information on restoring saved variables.

  Example of restoring the shadow variable values:

  ```python
  # Create a Saver that loads variables from their saved shadow values.
  shadow_var0_name = ema.average_name(var0)
  shadow_var1_name = ema.average_name(var1)
  saver = tf.train.Saver({shadow_var0_name: var0, shadow_var1_name: var1})
  saver.restore(...checkpoint filename...)
  # var0 and var1 now hold the moving average values
  ```

    The `apply()` method has to be called to create shadow variables and add

    The optional `num_updates` parameter allows one to tweak the decay rate
    dynamically. It is typical to pass the count of training steps, usually
    kept in a variable that is incremented at each step, in which case the
    decay rate is lower at the start of training.  This makes moving averages
