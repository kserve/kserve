    This initializes a new Kubernetes Cluster Resolver. The Cluster Resolver

    Args:
      job_to_label_mapping: A mapping of TensorFlow jobs to label selectors.
        This allows users to specify many TensorFlow jobs in one Cluster
        Resolver, and each job can have pods belong with different label
        selectors. For example, a sample mapping might be
        ```
        {'worker': ['job-name=worker-cluster-a', 'job-name=worker-cluster-b'],
         'ps': ['job-name=ps-1', 'job-name=ps-2']}

      tf_server_port: The port the TensorFlow server is listening on.
      rpc_layer: (Optional) The RPC layer TensorFlow should use to communicate
        between tasks in Kubernetes. Defaults to 'grpc'.
      override_client: The Kubernetes client (usually automatically retrieved
        using `from kubernetes import client as k8sclient`). If you pass this
        in, you are responsible for setting Kubernetes credentials manually.
