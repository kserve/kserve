        XLA (Accelerated Linear Algebra) is a domain-specific compiler for linear
        algebra that optimizes TensorFlow computations. The results are
        improvements in speed, memory usage, and portability on server and mobile
        platforms. The XLA framework is experimental and in active development.
        For details, read the <a href="./overview">XLA guide</a>.
