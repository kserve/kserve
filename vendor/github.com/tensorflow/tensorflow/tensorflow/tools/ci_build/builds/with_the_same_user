# This script is a wrapper creating the same user inside container as the one
# running the ci_build.sh outside the container. It also set the home directory
# for the user inside container to match the same absolute path as the workspace
# outside of container.
# We do this so that the bazel running inside container generate symbolic links
# and user permissions which makes sense outside of container.
# Do not run this manually. It does not make sense. It is intended to be called
# by ci_build.sh only.
