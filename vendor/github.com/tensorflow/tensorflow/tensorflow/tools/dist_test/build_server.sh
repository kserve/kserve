# Builds the test server for distributed (GRPC) TensorFlow
#
# Usage: build_server.sh <docker_image_name> <whl_file_location> [--test]
#
# Arguments:
#   docker_image_name: Name of the docker image to build.
#     E.g.: tensorflow/tf_grpc_test_server:0.11.0rc1
#
#   whl_file_location: URL from which the TensorFlow whl file will be downloaded.
#     E.g.: https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/cpu/tensorflow-1.5.0-cp27-none-linux_x86_64.whl
#     E.g.: /path/to/folder/tensorflow-0.11.0rc1-cp27-none-linux_x86_64.whl
#
# The optional flag --test lets the script to use the Dockerfile for the
# testing GRPC server. Without the flag, the script will build the non-test
# GRPC server.
#
# Note that the Dockerfile is located in ./server/ but the docker build should
# use the current directory as the context.
