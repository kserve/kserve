# TF Boosted Trees (TFBT)

TF Boosted trees is an implementation of a gradient boosting algorithm with
trees used as weak learners.

## Examples
Folder "examples" demonstrates how TFBT estimators can be used for various
problems. Namely, it contains:
* binary_mnist.py - an example on how to use TFBT for binary classification.
* mnist.py - a multiclass example.
* boston.py - a regression example.
