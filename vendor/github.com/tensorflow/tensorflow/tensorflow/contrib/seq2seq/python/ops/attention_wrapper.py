  Monotonic attention implies that the input sequence is processed in an

  addition, once an input sequence element is attended to at a given output
  timestep, elements occurring before it cannot be attended to at subsequent
  output timesteps.  This function generates attention distributions according
  to these assumptions.  For more information, see `Online and Linear-Time
  Attention by Enforcing Monotonic Alignments`.

  Args:
    p_choose_i: Probability of choosing input sequence/memory element i.  Should
      be of shape (batch_size, input_sequence_length), and should all be in the
      range [0, 1].
    previous_attention: The attention distribution from the previous output
      timestep.  Should be of shape (batch_size, input_sequence_length).  For
      the first output timestep, preevious_attention[n] should be [1, 0, 0, ...,
      0] for all n in [0, ... batch_size - 1].
    mode: How to compute the attention distribution.  Must be one of
      'recursive', 'parallel', or 'hard'.
        * 'recursive' uses tf.scan to recursively compute the distribution.
          This is slowest but is exact, general, and does not suffer from
          numerical instabilities.
        * 'parallel' uses parallelized cumulative-sum and cumulative-product
          operations to compute a closed-form solution to the recurrence
          relation defining the attention distribution.  This makes it more
          efficient than 'recursive', but it requires numerical checks which
          make the distribution non-exact.  This can be a problem in particular
          when input_sequence_length is long and/or p_choose_i has entries very
          close to 0 or 1.
        * 'hard' requires that the probabilities in p_choose_i are all either 0
          or 1, and subsequently uses a more efficient and exact solution.

  Returns:

    """Construct the `AttentionWrapper`.

    **NOTE** If you are using the `BeamSearchDecoder` with a cell wrapped in
    `AttentionWrapper`, then you must ensure that:

    - The encoder output has been tiled to `beam_width` via
      `tf.contrib.seq2seq.tile_batch` (NOT `tf.tile`).
    - The `batch_size` argument passed to the `zero_state` method of this
      wrapper is equal to `true_batch_size * beam_width`.
    - The initial state created with `zero_state` above contains a
      `cell_state` value containing properly tiled final state from the
      encoder.

    An example:

    ```
    tiled_encoder_outputs = tf.contrib.seq2seq.tile_batch(
        encoder_outputs, multiplier=beam_width)
    tiled_encoder_final_state = tf.conrib.seq2seq.tile_batch(
        encoder_final_state, multiplier=beam_width)
    tiled_sequence_length = tf.contrib.seq2seq.tile_batch(
        sequence_length, multiplier=beam_width)
    attention_mechanism = MyFavoriteAttentionMechanism(
        num_units=attention_depth,
        memory=tiled_inputs,
        memory_sequence_length=tiled_sequence_length)
    attention_cell = AttentionWrapper(cell, attention_mechanism, ...)
    decoder_initial_state = attention_cell.zero_state(
        dtype, batch_size=true_batch_size * beam_width)
    decoder_initial_state = decoder_initial_state.clone(
        cell_state=tiled_encoder_final_state)
    ```

    Args:
      cell: An instance of `RNNCell`.
      attention_mechanism: A list of `AttentionMechanism` instances or a single
        instance.
      attention_layer_size: A list of Python integers or a single Python
        integer, the depth of the attention (output) layer(s). If None
        (default), use the context as attention at each time step. Otherwise,
        feed the context and cell output into the attention layer to generate
        attention at each time step. If attention_mechanism is a list,
        attention_layer_size must be a list of the same length. If
        attention_layer is set, this must be None.
      alignment_history: Python boolean, whether to store alignment history
        from all time steps in the final output state (currently stored as a
        time major `TensorArray` on which you must call `stack()`).
      cell_input_fn: (optional) A `callable`.  The default is:
        `lambda inputs, attention: array_ops.concat([inputs, attention], -1)`.
      output_attention: Python bool.  If `True` (default), the output at each
        time step is the attention value.  This is the behavior of Luong-style
        attention mechanisms.  If `False`, the output at each time step is
        the output of `cell`.  This is the behavior of Bhadanau-style
        attention mechanisms.  In both cases, the `attention` tensor is
        propagated to the next time step via the state and is used there.
        This flag only controls whether the attention mechanism is propagated
        up to the next cell in an RNN stack or to the top RNN output.
      initial_cell_state: The initial state value to use for the cell when
        the user calls `zero_state()`.  Note that if this value is provided
        now, and the user uses a `batch_size` argument of `zero_state` which
        does not match the batch size of `initial_cell_state`, proper
        behavior is not guaranteed.
      name: Name to use when creating ops.
      attention_layer: A list of `tf.layers.Layer` instances or a
        single `tf.layers.Layer` instance taking the context and cell output as
        inputs to generate attention at each time step. If None (default), use
        the context as attention at each time step. If attention_mechanism is a
        list, attention_layer must be a list of the same length. If
        attention_layers_size is set, this must be None.

    Raises:
      TypeError: `attention_layer_size` is not None and (`attention_mechanism`
        is a list but `attention_layer_size` is not; or vice versa).
      ValueError: if `attention_layer_size` is not None, `attention_mechanism`
        is a list, and its length does not match that of `attention_layer_size`;
        if `attention_layer_size` and `attention_layer` are set simultaneously.
