"""Recurrent computation.

The main interface of this module is Recurrent().
A recurrent computation describes an auto-regressive process, where outputs
of one time step are fed to the output of the next time step.

This module uses:
  theta: the "weights" each RNN uses.
  state0: the initial state of each RNN.
  cell_fn: A python function describing RNN cell. It must has the following
    signature:
         cell_fn: (theta, state0, inputs) -> (state1, extras)
    state1 is the next RNN state, extras are computed by cell_fn
    and the library forwards extras to cell_fn's gradient function.
  cell_grad: A python function describing the backprop gradient function
    for the RNN cell. It must has the following signature:
         cell_grad: (theta, state0, inputs, extras, dstate1) -> (
                  dtheta, dstate0, dinputs)
    dstate1 is what the backprop algorithm provides representing
    gradients of state1 w.r.t. the final loss.

In this module, we handle structures of tensors for theta, state0, inputs,
and extras. The structure is an arbitrarily nested python structure, such
as a dictionary of named tuples.

Because the computation is a left-to-right chain, a single in-place accumulator
can be used rather than a stack. Thus a special gradient was written to reduce
unnecessary memory usage.

  Roughly, Recurrent() computes the following:
    state = state0
    for t in inputs' sequence length:
      state = cell_fn(theta, state, inputs[t, :])
      accumulate_state[t, :] = state
    return accumulate_state, state

  theta, state, inputs are all structures of tensors.

  inputs[t, :] means taking a slice out from every tensor in the inputs.

  accumulate_state[t, :] = state means that we stash every tensor in
  'state' into a slice of the corresponding tensor in
  accumulate_state.

  cell_fn is a python callable computing (building up a TensorFlow
  graph) the recurrent neural network's one forward step. Two calls of
  cell_fn must describe two identical computations.

  By construction, Recurrent()'s backward computation does not access
  any intermediate values computed by cell_fn during forward
  computation. We may extend Recurrent() to support that by taking a
  customized backward function of cell_fn.

  Args:
    theta: weights. A structure of tensors.
    state0: initial state. A structure of tensors.
    inputs: inputs. A structure of tensors.
    cell_fn: A python function, which computes:
      state1, extras = cell_fn(theta, state0, inputs[t, :])
    cell_grad: A python function which computes:
      dtheta, dstate0, dinputs[t, :] = cell_grad(
        theta, state0, inputs[t, :], extras, dstate1)
    extras: A structure of tensors. The 2nd return value of every
      invocation of cell_fn is a structure of tensors with matching keys
      and shapes of  this `extras`.
    max_input_length: maximum length of effective input. This is used to
      truncate the computation if the inputs have been allocated to a
      larger size. A scalar tensor.
    use_tpu: whether or not we are on TPU.
    aligned_end: A boolean indicating whether the sequence is aligned at
      the end.

    accumulate_state and the final state.
