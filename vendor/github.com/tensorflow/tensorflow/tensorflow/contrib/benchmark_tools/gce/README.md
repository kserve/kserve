# Distributed Tensorflow on Google Compute Engine

The scripts in this directory automate the work to run distributed TensorFlow on
a cluster of GCE instances.

## Pre-work

Before getting started, while GPUs on GCE are in Alpha, you will need to get
your project whitelisted in order to get access. These scripts will not work
until then.
