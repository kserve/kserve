  """Represents the composition of a set of Layers.

  *Deprecated*. Please inherit from `tf.keras.Model`, and see its documentation
  for details. `tf.keras.Model` should be a drop-in replacement for
  `tfe.Network` in most cases, but note that `track_layer` is no longer

  assignment (see the section of `tf.keras.Model`'s documentation on

  :).

  `Network` implements the `Layer` interface and adds convenience methods for
  managing sub-`Layer`s, such as listing variables.

  `Layer`s (including other `Network`s) should be added via `track_layer`. They
  can then be used when overriding the `Network.call` method:

  ```python
  class TwoLayerNetwork(tfe.Network):

    def __init__(self, name):
      super(TwoLayerNetwork, self).__init__(name=name)
      self.layer_one = self.track_layer(tf.layers.Dense(16, input_shape=(8,)))
      self.layer_two = self.track_layer(tf.layers.Dense(1, input_shape=(16,)))

    def call(self, inputs):
      return self.layer_two(self.layer_one(inputs))
  ```

  After constructing an object and calling the `Network`, a list of variables
  created by tracked `Layer`s is available via `Network.variables`:

  ```python
  net = TwoLayerNetwork(name="net")
  output = net(tf.ones([1, 8]))
  print([v.name for v in net.variables])
  ```

  This example prints variable names, one kernel and one bias per
  `tf.layers.Dense` layer:

  ```
  ['net/dense/kernel:0',
   'net/dense/bias:0',
   'net/dense_1/kernel:0',
   'net/dense_1/bias:0']
  ```

  These variables can be passed to a `Saver` (`tf.train.Saver`, or
  `tf.contrib.eager.Saver` when executing eagerly) to save or restore the
  `Network`, typically alongside a global step and `tf.train.Optimizer`
  variables when checkpointing during training.

  Note that the semantics of calling a `Network` with graph execution (i.e. not
  executing eagerly) may change slightly in the future. Currently stateful ops
  are pruned from the graph unless they or something that depends on them is
  executed in a session, but this behavior is not consistent with eager
  execution (where stateful ops are executed eagerly). `Layer`s from `tf.layers`
  do not depend on this pruning and so will not be affected, but `Network`s
  which rely on stateful ops being added to the graph but not executed (e.g. via
  custom `Layer`s which manage stateful ops) may break with this change.
