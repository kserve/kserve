"""Defines `{Additive,Multiplicative}SwapRegretOptimizer`s.

These optimizers minimize a `ConstrainedMinimizationProblem` by using a
swap-regret minimizing algorithm (either SGD or multiplicative weights) to learn
what weights should be associated with the objective function and constraints.
These algorithms do *not* use Lagrange multipliers, but the idea is similar.
The main differences between the formulation used here, and the standard
Lagrangian formulation, are that (i) the objective function is weighted, in
addition to the constraints, and (ii) we learn a matrix of weights, instead of a
vector.

For the purposes of constrained optimization, at least in theory,
external-regret minimization suffices if the `ConstrainedMinimizationProblem`
we're optimizing doesn't have any `proxy_constraints`, while swap-regret
minimization should be used if `proxy_constraints` are present.

For more specifics, please refer to:

> Constrained Optimization".

The formulation used by both of the SwapRegretOptimizers can be found in
Definition 2, and is discussed in Section 4. The
`MultiplicativeSwapRegretOptimizer` is most similar to Algorithm 2 in Section 4,
with the difference being that it uses `tf.train.Optimizer`s, instead of SGD,
for the "inner" updates. The `AdditiveSwapRegretOptimizer` differs further in
that it performs additive (instead of multiplicative) updates of the stochastic
matrix.

  This class contains most of the logic for performing constrained optimization,

  multiplicative updates, it's most natural to store its element-wise logarithm.
