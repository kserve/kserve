  """A transformation that parses `Example` protos into a `dict` of tensors.

  Parses a number of serialized `Example` protos given in `serialized`. We refer
  to `serialized` as a batch with `batch_size` many entries of individual
  `Example` protos.

  This op parses serialized examples into a dictionary mapping keys to `Tensor`
  and `SparseTensor` objects. `features` is a dict from keys to `VarLenFeature`,
  `SparseFeature`, and `FixedLenFeature` objects. Each `VarLenFeature`
  and `SparseFeature` is mapped to a `SparseTensor`, and each
  `FixedLenFeature` is mapped to a `Tensor`. See `tf.parse_example` for more
  details about feature dictionaries.

  Args:
   features: A `dict` mapping feature keys to `FixedLenFeature`,
     `VarLenFeature`, and `SparseFeature` values.
   num_parallel_calls: (Optional.) A `tf.int32` scalar `tf.Tensor`,
      representing the number of parsing processes to call in parallel.

  Returns:
    A dataset transformation function, which can be passed to
    `tf.data.Dataset.apply`.

  Raises:
    ValueError: if features argument is None.
