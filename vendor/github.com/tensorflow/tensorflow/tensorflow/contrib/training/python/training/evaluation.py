"""Contains functions for evaluation and summarization of metrics.

The evaluation.py module contains helper functions for evaluating TensorFlow
modules using a variety of metrics and summarizing the results.

****************************************
* Evaluating a Checkpointed Model Once *
****************************************

Once we've trained a model, we'll want to evaluate it. The simplest way to do
this is to evaluate the performance of a saved model a single time. In order
to do this, we can specify a number of metrics we'll want to evaluate as well
as specify the summaries we want to save to disk. Furthermore, we can print
out the metrics values to stdout:

  # Specify where the checkpoint is stored:
  checkpoint_path = ...

  # Create model and obtain the predictions:
  images, labels = LoadData(...)
  predictions = MyModel(images)

  # Choose the metrics to compute:
  names_to_values, names_to_updates = tf.contrib.metrics.aggregate_metric_map({
      "accuracy": tf.metrics.accuracy(labels, predictions),
      "mse": tf.metrics.mean_squared_error(labels, predictions),
  })

  # Define the summaries to write:
  for metric_name, metric_value in metrics_to_values.iteritems():
    tf.summary.scalar(metric_name, metric_value)

  checkpoint_dir = '/tmp/my_model_dir/'
  log_dir = '/tmp/my_model_eval/'

  # We'll evaluate 1000 batches:
  num_evals = 1000

  names_to_values = evaluate_once(
      checkpoint_path=checkpoint_path,
      eval_ops=names_to_updates.values(),
      final_ops=names_to_values,
      hooks=[
            tf.contrib.training.StopAfterNEvalsHook(num_evals),
            tf.contrib.training.SummaryAtEndHook(logdir),
      ],
      config=None)

  for name in names_to_values:
    print('Metric %s has value %f.' % (name, names_to_values[name]))


************************************************
* Evaluating a Checkpointed Model with Metrics *
************************************************

Often, one wants to evaluate a model checkpoint saved on disk. This can be
performed once or repeatedly on a set schedule.

To evaluate a particular model, users define zero or more metrics and zero or
more summaries and call the evaluate_repeatedly method:

  # Create model and obtain the predictions:
  images, labels = LoadData(...)
  predictions = MyModel(images)

  # Choose the metrics to compute:
  names_to_values, names_to_updates = tf.contrib.metrics.aggregate_metric_map({
      "accuracy": tf.metrics.accuracy(labels, predictions),
      "mse": tf.metrics.mean_squared_error(labels, predictions),
  })

  # Define the summaries to write:
  for metric_name, metric_value in metrics_to_values.iteritems():
    tf.summary.scalar(metric_name, metric_value)

  checkpoint_dir = '/tmp/my_model_dir/'
  log_dir = '/tmp/my_model_eval/'

  # We'll evaluate 1000 batches:
  num_evals = 1000

  # Evaluate every 10 minutes:
  tf.contrib.training.evaluate_repeatedly(
      checkpoint_dir,
      eval_ops=names_to_updates.values(),
      hooks=[
            tf.contrib.training.StopAfterNEvalsHook(num_evals),
            tf.contrib.training.SummaryAtEndHook(logdir),
      ],
      eval_interval_secs=600)

*******************************************************
* Evaluating a Checkpointed Model with Summaries Only *
*******************************************************

At times, an evaluation can be performed without metrics at all but rather
with only summaries. The user need only leave out the 'eval_ops' argument:

  # Create model and obtain the predictions:
  images, labels = LoadData(...)
  predictions = MyModel(images)

  # Define the summaries to write:
  tf.summary.scalar(...)
  tf.summary.histogram(...)

  checkpoint_dir = '/tmp/my_model_dir/'
  log_dir = '/tmp/my_model_eval/'

  # Evaluate once every 10 minutes.
  tf.contrib.training.evaluate_repeatedly(
      checkpoint_dir,
      hooks=[
          tf.contrib.training.SummaryAtEndHook(logdir),
      ],
      eval_interval_secs=600)

  """Continuously yield new checkpoint files as they appear.

  The iterator only checks for new checkpoints when control flow has been
  reverted to it. This means it can miss checkpoints if your code takes longer
  to run between iterations than `min_interval_secs` or the interval at which
  new checkpoints are written.

  The `timeout` argument is the maximum number of seconds to block waiting for
  a new checkpoint.  It is used in combination with the `timeout_fn` as
  follows:

  * If the timeout expires and no `timeout_fn` was specified, the iterator
    stops yielding.
  * If a `timeout_fn` was specified, that function is called and if it returns
    a true boolean value the iterator stops yielding.
  * If the function returns a false boolean value then the iterator resumes the
    wait for new checkpoints.  At this point the timeout logic applies again.

  This behavior gives control to callers on what to do if checkpoints do not
  come fast enough or stop being generated.  For example, if callers have a way
  to detect that the training has stopped and know that no new checkpoints
  will be generated, they can provide a `timeout_fn` that returns `True` when
  the training has stopped.  If they know that the training is still going on
  they return `False` instead.

  Args:
    checkpoint_dir: The directory in which checkpoints are saved.
    min_interval_secs: The minimum number of seconds between yielding
      checkpoints.
    timeout: The maximum amount of time to wait between checkpoints. If left as
      `None`, then the process will wait indefinitely.
    timeout_fn: Optional function to call after a timeout.  If the function
      returns True, then it means that no new checkpoints will be generated and
      the iterator will exit.  The function is called with no arguments.

  Yields:

  During a single evaluation, the `eval_ops` is run until the session is
  interrupted or requested to finish. This is typically requested via a
  `tf.contrib.training.StopAfterNEvalsHook` which results in `eval_ops` running
  the requested number of times.

  Optionally, a user can pass in `final_ops`, a single `Tensor`, a list of
  `Tensors` or a dictionary from names to `Tensors`. The `final_ops` is
  evaluated a single time after `eval_ops` has finished running and the fetched
  values of `final_ops` are returned. If `final_ops` is left as `None`, then
  `None` is returned.

  One may also consider using a `tf.contrib.training.SummaryAtEndHook` to record
  summaries after the `eval_ops` have run. If `eval_ops` is `None`, the
  summaries run immediately after the model checkpoint has been restored.

  Note that `evaluate_once` creates a local variable used to track the number of
  evaluations run via `tf.contrib.training.get_or_create_eval_step`.
  Consequently, if a custom local init op is provided via a `scaffold`, the
  caller should ensure that the local init op also initializes the eval step.

  Args:
    checkpoint_dir: The directory where checkpoints are stored.
    master: The address of the TensorFlow master.
    scaffold: An tf.train.Scaffold instance for initializing variables and
      restoring variables. Note that `scaffold.init_fn` is used by the function
      to restore the checkpoint. If you supply a custom init_fn, then it must
      also take care of restoring the model from its checkpoint.
    eval_ops: A single `Tensor`, a list of `Tensors` or a dictionary of names
      to `Tensors`, which is run until the session is requested to stop,
      commonly done by a `tf.contrib.training.StopAfterNEvalsHook`.
    feed_dict: The feed dictionary to use when executing the `eval_ops`.
    final_ops: A single `Tensor`, a list of `Tensors` or a dictionary of names
      to `Tensors`.
    final_ops_feed_dict: A feed dictionary to use when evaluating `final_ops`.
    eval_interval_secs: The minimum number of seconds between evaluations.
    hooks: List of `tf.train.SessionRunHook` callbacks which are run inside the
      evaluation loop.
    config: An instance of `tf.ConfigProto` that will be used to
      configure the `Session`. If left as `None`, the default will be used.
    max_number_of_evaluations: The maximum times to run the evaluation. If left
      as `None`, then evaluation runs indefinitely.
    timeout: The maximum amount of time to wait between checkpoints. If left as
      `None`, then the process will wait indefinitely.
    timeout_fn: Optional function to call after a timeout.  If the function
      returns True, then it means that no new checkpoints will be generated and
