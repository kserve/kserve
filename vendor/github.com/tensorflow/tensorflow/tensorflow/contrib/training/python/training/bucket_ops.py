  """Lazy bucketing of input tensors according to `which_bucket`.

  The argument `tensors` can be a list or a dictionary of tensors.
  The value returned by the function will be of the same type
  as `tensors`.

  The tensors entering this function are put into the bucket given by
  `which_bucket`.  Each bucket has its own queue.  When a bucket contains
  `batch_size` elements, this minibatch is pushed onto a top queue.  The
  tensors returned from this function are a the result of dequeueing the
  next minibatch from this top queue.

  This function is implemented using several queues. A `QueueRunner` for the
  queues is added to the current `Graph`'s `QUEUE_RUNNER` collection.

  As the returned tensors are the result of a dequeue operation, evaluating
  them will throw a `tf.errors.OutOfRangeError` when the input queue is
  exhausted.  If these tensors are feeding another input queue, its queue runner
  will catch this exception, however, if they are used in your main thread
  you are responsible for catching this yourself.

  *N.B.:* If `dynamic_pad` is `False`, you must ensure that either
  (i) the `shapes` argument is passed, or (ii) all of the tensors in
  `tensors` must have fully-defined shapes. `ValueError` will be
  raised if neither of these conditions holds.

  If `dynamic_pad` is `True`, it is sufficient that the *rank* of the
  tensors is known, but individual dimensions may have shape `None`.
  In this case, for each enqueue the dimensions with value `None`
  may have a variable length; upon dequeue, the output tensors will be padded
  on the right to the maximum shape of the tensors in the current minibatch.
  For numbers, this padding takes value 0.  For strings, this padding is
  the empty string.  See `PaddingFIFOQueue` for more info.

  If `allow_smaller_final_batch` is `True`, a smaller batch value than
  `batch_size` is returned when the queues are closed and there are not enough
  elements to fill the batch, otherwise the pending elements are discarded.
  In addition, all output tensors' static shapes, as accessed via the
  `get_shape()` method will have a 0th `Dimension` value of `None`, and
  operations that depend on fixed batch_size would fail.

  Args:
    tensors: The list or dictionary of tensors, representing a single element,
      to bucket.  Nested lists are not supported.
    which_bucket: An `int32` scalar Tensor taking a value in `[0, num_buckets)`.
    batch_size: The new batch size pulled from the queue (all queues will have
      the same size).  If a list is passed in then each bucket will have a
      different batch_size.
      (python int, int32 scalar or iterable of integers of length num_buckets).
    num_buckets: A python integer, the number of buckets.
    num_threads: An integer.  The number of threads enqueuing `tensors`.
    capacity: An integer. The maximum number of minibatches in the top queue,
      and also (by default) the maximum number of elements within each bucket.
    bucket_capacities: (Optional) None or a list of integers, the capacities of
      each bucket. If None, capacity is used (default). If specified, it must
      be a list of integers of length num_buckets: the i-th element is used
      as capacity for the i-th bucket queue.
    shapes: (Optional) The shapes for each example.  Defaults to the
      inferred shapes for `tensors`.
    dynamic_pad: Boolean.  Allow variable dimensions in input shapes.
      The given dimensions are padded upon dequeue so that tensors within a
      batch have the same shapes.
    allow_smaller_final_batch: (Optional) Boolean. If `True`, allow the final
      batches to be smaller if there are insufficient items left in the queues.
    keep_input: A `bool` scalar Tensor.  If provided, this tensor controls
      whether the input is added to the queue or not.  If it evaluates `True`,
      then `tensors` are added to the bucket; otherwise they are dropped.  This
      tensor essentially acts as a filtering mechanism.
    shared_name: (Optional). If set, the queues will be shared under the given
      name across multiple sessions.
    name: (Optional) A name for the operations.

  Returns:
    A tuple `(bucket, outputs)` where `bucket` is
    a `int32` scalar tensor and `outputs` is a list or
    dictionary of batched outputs corresponding to elements of `tensors`.
    Every step will receive a new bucket of outputs.

  Raises:
    ValueError: If the `shapes` are not specified, and cannot be
      inferred from the elements of `tensors` or if batch_size is a sequence
      but its length != num_buckets. Also if bucket_capacities is not None but
      its length != num_buckets.

  """Lazy bucketing of inputs according to their length.

  This method calls `tf.contrib.training.bucket` under the hood, after first
  subdividing the bucket boundaries into separate buckets and identifying which
  bucket the given `input_length` belongs to.  See the documentation for
  `which_bucket` for details of the other arguments.

  Args:
    input_length: `int32` scalar `Tensor`, the sequence length of tensors.
    tensors: The list or dictionary of tensors, representing a single element,
      to bucket.  Nested lists are not supported.
    batch_size: The new batch size pulled from the queue (all queues will have
      the same size).  If a list is passed in then each bucket will have a
      different batch_size.
      (python int, int32 scalar or iterable of integers of length num_buckets).
    bucket_boundaries: int list, increasing non-negative numbers.
      The edges of the buckets to use when bucketing tensors.  Two extra buckets
      are created, one for `input_length < bucket_boundaries[0]` and
      one for `input_length >= bucket_boundaries[-1]`.
    num_threads: An integer.  The number of threads enqueuing `tensors`.
    capacity: An integer. The maximum number of minibatches in the top queue,
      and also the maximum number of elements within each bucket.
    bucket_capacities: (Optional) None or a list of integers, the capacities of
      each bucket. If None, capacity is used (default). If specified, it must
      be a list of integers of length one larger than bucket_boundaries.
      Its i-th element is used as capacity for the i-th bucket queue.
    shapes: (Optional) The shapes for each example.  Defaults to the
      inferred shapes for `tensors`.
    dynamic_pad: Boolean.  Allow variable dimensions in input shapes.
      The given dimensions are padded upon dequeue so that tensors within a
      batch have the same shapes.

      batches to be smaller if there are insufficient items left in the queues.
