class SequenceQueueingStateSaver(object):
  """SequenceQueueingStateSaver provides access to stateful values from input.

  This class is meant to be used instead of, e.g., a `Queue`, for splitting
  variable-length sequence inputs into segments of sequences with fixed length
  and batching them into mini-batches.  It maintains contexts and state for a
  sequence across the segments.  It can be used in conjunction with a
  `QueueRunner` (see the example below).

  The `SequenceQueueingStateSaver` (SQSS) accepts one example at a time via the
  inputs `input_length`, `input_key`, `input_sequences` (a dict),
  `input_context` (a dict), and `initial_states` (a dict).
  The sequences, values in `input_sequences`, may have variable first dimension
  (the `padded_length`), though this dimension must always be a multiple of
  `num_unroll`.  All other dimensions must be fixed and accessible via
  `get_shape` calls.  The length prior to padding can be recorded in
  `input_length`.  The context values in `input_context` must all have fixed and
  well defined dimensions.  The initial state values must all have fixed and
  well defined dimensions.

  The SQSS splits the sequences of an input example into segments of length
  `num_unroll`.  Across examples minibatches of size `batch_size` are formed.
  These minibatches contain a segment of the sequences, copy the context values,
  and maintain state, length, and key information of the original input
  examples.  In the first segment of an example the state is still the initial
  state.  It can then be updated; and updated state values are accessible in
  subsequent segments of the same example. After each segment
  `batch.save_state()` must be called which is done by the state_saving_rnn.
  Without this call, the dequeue op associated with the SQSS will not run.
  Internally, SQSS has a queue for the input examples. Its `capacity` is
  configurable.  If set smaller than `batch_size` then the dequeue op will block
  indefinitely.  A small multiple of `batch_size` is a good rule of thumb to
  prevent that queue from becoming a bottleneck and slowing down training.
  If set too large (and note that it defaults to unbounded) memory consumption
  goes up.  Moreover, when iterating over the same input examples multiple times
  reusing the same `key` the `capacity` must be smaller than the number of
  examples.

  The prefetcher, which reads one unrolled, variable-length input sequence at
  a time, is accessible via `prefetch_op`.  The underlying `Barrier` object
  is accessible via `barrier`.  Processed minibatches, as well as
  state read and write capabilities are accessible via `next_batch`.
  Specifically, `next_batch` provides access to all of the minibatched
  data, including the following, see `NextQueuedSequenceBatch` for details:

  *  `total_length`, `length`, `insertion_index`, `key`, `next_key`,
  *  `sequence` (the index each minibatch entry's time segment index),
  *  `sequence_count` (the total time segment count for each minibatch entry),
  *  `context` (a dict of the copied minibatched context values),
  *  `sequences` (a dict of the split minibatched variable-length sequences),
  *  `state` (to access the states of the current segments of these entries)
  *  `save_state` (to save the states for the next segments of these entries)

  Example usage:

  ```python
  batch_size = 32
  num_unroll = 20
  lstm_size = 8
  cell = tf.contrib.rnn.BasicLSTMCell(num_units=lstm_size)
  initial_state_values = tf.zeros(cell.state_size, dtype=tf.float32)

  raw_data = get_single_input_from_input_reader()
  length, key, sequences, context = my_parser(raw_data)
  assert "input" in sequences.keys()
  assert "label" in context.keys()
  initial_states = {"lstm_state": initial_state_value}

  stateful_reader = tf.SequenceQueueingStateSaver(
      batch_size, num_unroll,
      length=length, input_key=key, input_sequences=sequences,
      input_context=context, initial_states=initial_states,
      capacity=batch_size*100)

  batch = stateful_reader.next_batch
  inputs = batch.sequences["input"]
  context_label = batch.context["label"]

  inputs_by_time = tf.split(value=inputs, num_or_size_splits=num_unroll, axis=1)
  assert len(inputs_by_time) == num_unroll

  lstm_output, _ = tf.contrib.rnn.static_state_saving_rnn(
    cell,
    inputs_by_time,
    state_saver=batch,
    state_name="lstm_state")

  # Start a prefetcher in the background
  sess = tf.Session()
  num_threads = 3
  queue_runner = tf.train.QueueRunner(
      stateful_reader, [stateful_reader.prefetch_op] * num_threads)
  tf.train.add_queue_runner(queue_runner)
  tf.train.start_queue_runners(sess=session)

  while True:
    # Step through batches, perform training or inference...
    session.run([lstm_output])
  ```

  **Note**: Usually the barrier is given to a QueueRunner as in the
      examples above.  The QueueRunner will close the barrier if the prefetch_op
      receives an OutOfRange Error from upstream input queues (i.e., reaches
      the end of the input).  If the barrier is closed no further new examples
      are added to the SQSS.  The underlying barrier might, however, still
      contain further unroll-steps of examples that have not undergone all
      iterations.  To gracefully finish all examples, the flag
      `allow_small_batch` must be set to true, which causes the SQSS to issue
      progressively smaller mini-batches with the remaining examples.

    """Creates the SequenceQueueingStateSaver.

    Args:
      batch_size: int or int32 scalar `Tensor`, how large minibatches should
        be when accessing the `state()` method and `context`, `sequences`, etc,
        properties.
      num_unroll: Python integer, how many time steps to unroll at a time.
        The input sequences of length `k` are then split into `k / num_unroll`
        many segments.
      input_length: An int32 scalar `Tensor`, the length of the sequence prior
        to padding.  This value may be at most `padded_length` for any given
        input (see below for the definition of `padded_length`).
        Batched and total lengths of the current iteration are made accessible
        via the `length` and `total_length` properties.  The shape of
        input_length (scalar) must be fully specified.
      input_key: A string scalar `Tensor`, the **unique** key for the given
        input.  This is used to keep track of the split minibatch elements
        of this input.  Batched keys of the current iteration are made
        accessible via the `key` property.  The shape of `input_key` (scalar)
        must be fully specified.
      input_sequences: A dict mapping string names to `Tensor` values.  The
        values must all have matching first dimension, called `padded_length`.
        The `SequenceQueueingStateSaver` will split these tensors along
        this first dimension into minibatch elements of dimension
        `num_unroll`. Batched and segmented sequences of the current iteration
        are made accessible via the `sequences` property.

        **Note**: `padded_length` may be dynamic, and may vary from input
        to input, but must always be a multiple of `num_unroll`.  The remainder
        of the shape (other than the first dimension) must be fully specified.
      input_context: A dict mapping string names to `Tensor` values.  The values
        are treated as "global" across all time splits of the given input,
        and will be copied across for all minibatch elements accordingly.
        Batched and copied context of the current iteration are made
        accessible via the `context` property.

        **Note**: All input_context values must have fully defined shapes.
      initial_states: A dict mapping string state names to multi-dimensional
        values (e.g. constants or tensors).  This input defines the set of
        states that will be kept track of during computing iterations, and
        which can be accessed via the `state` and `save_state` methods.

        **Note**: All initial_state values must have fully defined shapes.
      capacity: The max capacity of the SQSS in number of examples. Needs to be
        at least `batch_size`. Defaults to unbounded.
      allow_small_batch: If true, the SQSS will return smaller batches when
        there aren't enough input examples to fill a whole batch and the end of
        the input has been reached (i.e., the underlying barrier has been
        closed).
      name: An op name string (optional).

    Raises:
      TypeError: if any of the inputs is not an expected type.

  """Creates batches of segments of sequential input.

  This method creates a `SequenceQueueingStateSaver` (SQSS) and adds it to
  the queuerunners. It returns a `NextQueuedSequenceBatch`.

  It accepts one example at a time identified by a unique `input_key`.
  `input_sequence` is a dict with values that are tensors with time as first
  dimension. This time dimension must be the same across those tensors of an
  example. It can vary across examples. Although it always has to be a multiple
  of `num_unroll`. Hence, padding may be necessary and it is turned on by
  default by `pad=True`.

  `input_length` is a Tensor scalar or an int recording the time dimension prior
  to padding. It should be between 0 and the time dimension. One reason we want
  to keep track of it is so that we can take it into consideration when
  computing the loss. If `pad=True` then `input_length` can be `None` and will
  be inferred.

  This methods segments `input_sequence` into segments of length `num_unroll`.
  It batches input sequences from `batch_size` many examples. These mini-batches
  are available through the `sequence` property of the output. Moreover, for
  each entry in the batch we can access its original `input_key` in `key` and
  its input length in `total_length`. `length` records within this segment how
  many non-padded time steps there are.

  Static features of an example that do not vary across time can be part of the
  `input_context`, a dict with Tensor values. This method copies the context for
  each segment and makes it available in the `context` of the output.

  This method can maintain and update a state for each example. It accepts some
  initial_states as a dict with Tensor values. The first mini-batch an example
  is contained has initial_states as entry of the `state`. If save_state is
  called then the next segment will have the updated entry of the `state`.
  See `NextQueuedSequenceBatch` for a complete list of properties and methods.

  Args:
    input_key: A string scalar `Tensor`, the **unique** key for the given
      input example.  This is used to keep track of the split minibatch elements
      of this input.  Batched keys of the current iteration are made
      accessible via the `key` property.  The shape of `input_key` (scalar) must
      be fully specified.  Consider setting `make_keys_unique` to True when
      iterating over the same input multiple times.

      **Note**: if `make_keys_unique=False` then `input_key`s must be unique.
    input_sequences: A dict mapping string names to `Tensor` values.  The values
      must all have matching first dimension, called `value_length`. They may
      vary from input to input. The remainder of the shape (other than the first
      dimension) must be fully specified.
      The `SequenceQueueingStateSaver` will split these tensors along
      this first dimension into minibatch elements of dimension `num_unrolled`.
      Batched and segmented sequences of the current iteration are made
      accessible via the `sequences` property.

      **Note**: if `pad=False`, then `value_length` must always be a multiple
        of `num_unroll`.
    input_context: A dict mapping string names to `Tensor` values.  The values
      are treated as "global" across all time splits of the given input example,
      and will be copied across for all minibatch elements accordingly.
      Batched and copied context of the current iteration are made
      accessible via the `context` property.

      **Note**: All input_context values must have fully defined shapes.
    input_length: None or an int32 scalar `Tensor`, the length of the sequence
      prior to padding. If `input_length=None` and `pad=True` then the length
      will be inferred and will be equal to `value_length`. If `pad=False` then
      `input_length` cannot be `None`: `input_length` must be specified. Its
      shape of `input_length` (scalar) must be fully specified. Its value may be
      at most `value_length` for any given input (see above for the definition
      of `value_length`). Batched and total lengths of the current iteration are
      made accessible via the `length` and `total_length` properties.
    initial_states: A dict mapping string state names to multi-dimensional
      values (e.g. constants or tensors).  This input defines the set of
      states that will be kept track of during computing iterations, and
      which can be accessed via the `state` and `save_state` methods.

      **Note**: All initial_state values must have fully defined shapes.
    num_unroll: Python integer, how many time steps to unroll at a time.
      The input sequences of length k are then split into k / num_unroll many
      segments.
    batch_size: int or int32 scalar `Tensor`, how large minibatches should
      be when accessing the `state()` method and `context`, `sequences`, etc,
      properties.
    num_threads: The int number of threads enqueuing input examples into a
      queue.
    capacity: The max capacity of the queue in number of examples. Needs to be
      at least `batch_size`. Defaults to 1000. When iterating over the same
      input example multiple times reusing their keys the `capacity` must be
      smaller than the number of examples.
    allow_small_batch: If true, the queue will return smaller batches when
      there aren't enough input examples to fill a whole batch and the end of
      the input has been reached.
    pad: If `True`, `input_sequences` will be padded to multiple of
      `num_unroll`. In that case `input_length` may be `None` and is assumed to
      be the length of first dimension of values in `input_sequences`
      (i.e. `value_length`).
    make_keys_unique: Whether to append a random integer to the `input_key` in
      an effort to make it unique. The seed can be set via
      `make_keys_unique_seed`.
    make_keys_unique_seed: If `make_keys_unique=True` this fixes the seed with
      which a random postfix is generated.
    name: An op name string (optional).

  Returns:
    A NextQueuedSequenceBatch with segmented and batched inputs and their
    states.

  Raises:
    TypeError: if any of the inputs is not an expected type.
    ValueError: if any of the input values is inconsistent, e.g. if
      not enough shape information is available from inputs to build
      the state saver.
