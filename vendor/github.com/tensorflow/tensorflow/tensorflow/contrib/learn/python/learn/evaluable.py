    """Evaluates given model with provided evaluation data.

    Stop conditions - we evaluate on the given input data until one of the
    following:
    - If `steps` is provided, and `steps` batches of size `batch_size` are
    processed.
    - If `input_fn` is provided, and it raises an end-of-input
    exception (`OutOfRangeError` or `StopIteration`).
    - If `x` is provided, and all items in `x` have been processed.

    The return value is a dict containing the metrics specified in `metrics`, as
    well as an entry `global_step` which contains the value of the global step
    for which this evaluation was performed.

    Args:
      x: Matrix of shape [n_samples, n_features...] or dictionary of many
        matrices
        containing the input samples for fitting the model. Can be iterator that
          returns
        arrays of features or dictionary of array of features. If set,
          `input_fn` must
        be `None`.
      y: Vector or matrix [n_samples] or [n_samples, n_outputs] containing the
        label values (class labels in classification, real numbers in
        regression) or dictionary of multiple vectors/matrices. Can be iterator
        that returns array of targets or dictionary of array of targets. If set,
        `input_fn` must be `None`. Note: For classification, label values must
        be integers representing the class index (i.e. values from 0 to
        n_classes-1).
      input_fn: Input function returning a tuple of:
        features - Dictionary of string feature name to `Tensor` or `Tensor`.
        labels - `Tensor` or dictionary of `Tensor` with labels.
        If input_fn is set, `x`, `y`, and `batch_size` must be `None`. If
        `steps` is not provided, this should raise `OutOfRangeError` or
        `StopIteration` after the desired amount of data (e.g., one epoch) has
        been provided. See "Stop conditions" above for specifics.
      feed_fn: Function creating a feed dict every time it is called. Called
        once per iteration. Must be `None` if `input_fn` is provided.
      batch_size: minibatch size to use on the input, defaults to first
        dimension of `x`, if specified. Must be `None` if `input_fn` is
        provided.
      steps: Number of steps for which to evaluate model. If `None`, evaluate
        until `x` is consumed or `input_fn` raises an end-of-input exception.
        See "Stop conditions" above for specifics.
      metrics: Dict of metrics to run. If None, the default metric functions
        are used; if {}, no metrics are used. Otherwise, `metrics` should map
        friendly names for the metric to a `MetricSpec` object defining which
        model outputs to evaluate against which labels with which metric
        function.
        Metric ops should support streaming, e.g., returning `update_op` and
        `value` tensors. For example, see the options defined in
        `../../../metrics/python/ops/metrics_ops.py`.
      name: Name of the evaluation if user needs to run multiple evaluations on
        different data sets, such as on training data vs test data.
      checkpoint_path: Path of a specific checkpoint to evaluate. If `None`, the
        latest checkpoint in `model_dir` is used.
      hooks: List of `SessionRunHook` subclass instances. Used for callbacks
        inside the evaluation call.

    Returns:
      Returns `dict` with evaluation results.
