"""TensorFlow Ops to work with embeddings (deprecated).

This module and all its submodules are deprecated. See
[contrib/learn/README.md](https://www.tensorflow.org/code/tensorflow/contrib/learn/README.md)
for migration instructions.

Note: categorical variables are handled via embeddings in many cases.
For example, in case of words.
