  """Perform prediction using an exported saved model.

  Analogous to _input_pipeline.predict_continuation_input_fn, but operates on a
  saved model rather than feeding into Estimator's predict method.

  Args:
    continue_from: A dictionary containing the results of either an Estimator's
      evaluate method or filter_continuation. Used to determine the model
      state to make predictions starting from.
    signatures: The `MetaGraphDef` protocol buffer returned from
      `tf.saved_model.loader.load`. Used to determine the names of Tensors to
      feed and fetch. Must be from the same model as `continue_from`.
    session: The session to use. The session's graph must be the one into which
      `tf.saved_model.loader.load` loaded the model.
    steps: The number of steps to predict (scalar), starting after the
      evaluation or filtering. If `times` is specified, `steps` must not be; one
      is required.
    times: A [batch_size x window_size] array of integers (not a Tensor)
      indicating times to make predictions for. These times must be after the
      corresponding evaluation or filtering. If `steps` is specified, `times`
      must not be; one is required. If the batch dimension is omitted, it is
      assumed to be 1.
    exogenous_features: Optional dictionary. If specified, indicates exogenous
      features for the model to use while making the predictions. Values must
      have shape [batch_size x window_size x ...], where `batch_size` matches
      the batch dimension used when creating `continue_from`, and `window_size`
      is either the `steps` argument or the `window_size` of the `times`
      argument (depending on which was specified).
  Returns:
    A dictionary with model-specific predictions (typically having keys "mean"
    and "covariance") and a feature_keys.PredictionResults.TIMES key indicating
    the times for which the predictions were computed.
  Raises:
    ValueError: If `times` or `steps` are misspecified.

    session: The session to use. The session's graph must be the one into which

    features: A dictionary mapping keys to Numpy arrays, with several possible
      shapes (requires keys `FilteringFeatures.TIMES` and
      `FilteringFeatures.VALUES`):
        Single example; `TIMES` is a scalar and `VALUES` is either a scalar or a
