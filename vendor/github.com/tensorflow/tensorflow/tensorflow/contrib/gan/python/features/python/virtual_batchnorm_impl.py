        axis). For instance, after a `Convolution2D` layer with

      epsilon: Small float added to variance to avoid dividing by zero.
      center: If True, add offset of `beta` to normalized tensor. If False,
        `beta` is ignored.
      scale: If True, multiply by `gamma`. If False, `gamma` is
        not used. When the next layer is linear (also e.g. `nn.relu`), this can
        be disabled since the scaling can be done by the next layer.

      beta_regularizer: Optional regularizer for the beta weight.
      gamma_regularizer: Optional regularizer for the gamma weight.
      trainable: Boolean, if `True` also add variables to the graph collection
        `GraphKeys.TRAINABLE_VARIABLES` (see tf.Variable).
      name: String, the name of the ops.
      batch_axis: The axis of the batch dimension. This dimension is treated
        differently in `virtual batch normalization` vs `batch normalization`.
