      description: >
        <p>If models don’t cover your use cases, you can always
        bring your own existing TensorFlow Lite models. Just upload your model,
        and we’ll take care of hosting and serving it to your app.</p>

        <p>Models acts as an API layer to your custom model, making it easy to
        run and use. In addition to deploying your models, we are releasing an
        experimental model compression flow that aims to reduce model size (up
        to orders of magnitudes) while maintaining similar accuracy. Sign up at
        <a href="https://g.co/firebase/signup">g.co/firebase/signup</a></p>

        <p>And if you’re new to machine learning and want more information on
        custom models for mobile, you can <a

        Our ultimate goal is to reduce idea–to–implementation cycles and make AI
        an essential and intuitive part of a developer's toolkit. We will do so
        by continuing to add new Base APIs that leverage Google’s machine
        learning expertise. Base APIs will ultimately cover significantly more
        use cases in the vision, speech, and text fields. We will also continue
        to simplify use of custom models, adding tools to deploy, compress, and
        create them.
