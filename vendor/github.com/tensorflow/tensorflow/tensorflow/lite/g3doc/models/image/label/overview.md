# Overview

Image labeling gives you insight into the content of images. When you use the
API, you get a list of the entities that were recognized: people, things,
places, activities, and so on. Each label found comes with a score that
indicates the confidence the ML model has in its relevance. With this
information, you can perform tasks such as automatic metadata generation
and content moderation.
