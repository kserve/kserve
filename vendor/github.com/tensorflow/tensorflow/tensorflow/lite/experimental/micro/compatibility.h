// C++ will automatically create class-specific delete operators for virtual
// objects, which by default call the global delete function. For embedded
// applications we want to avoid this, and won't be calling new/delete on these
// objects, so we need to override the default implementation with one that does
// nothing to avoid linking in ::delete().
// This macro needs to be included in all subclasses of a virtual base class in
// the private section.
