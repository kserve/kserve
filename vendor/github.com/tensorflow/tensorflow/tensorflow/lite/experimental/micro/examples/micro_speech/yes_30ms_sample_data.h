// This data was created from the PCM data in a WAV file held in v2 of the
// Speech Commands test dataset, at the path:
// speech_commands_test_set_v0.02/yes/f2e59fea_nohash_1.wav
// The data was extracted starting at an offset of 8,000, which corresponds to
// the 26th spectrogram slice. It's designed to be used to test the
// preprocessing pipeline, to ensure that the expected spectrogram slice is
// produced given this input.
