The binary frontend_main shows sample usage of the frontend, printing out
coefficients when it has processed enough data.

The binary frontend_memmap_main shows a sample usage of how to avoid all the
init code in your runtime, by first running "frontend_generate_memmap" to
create a header/source file that uses a baked in frontend state. This command
could be automated as part of your build process, or you can just use the output
directly.
