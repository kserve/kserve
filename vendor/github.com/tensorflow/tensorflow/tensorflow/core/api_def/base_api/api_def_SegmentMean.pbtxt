Read
[the section on segmentation](https://tensorflow.org/api_guides/python/math_ops#Segmentation)
for an explanation of segments.

Computes a tensor such that
\\(output_i = \frac{\sum_j data_j}{N}\\) where `mean` is
over `j` such that `segment_ids[j] == i` and `N` is the total number of
values summed.

If the mean is empty for a given segment ID `i`, `output[i] = 0`.
