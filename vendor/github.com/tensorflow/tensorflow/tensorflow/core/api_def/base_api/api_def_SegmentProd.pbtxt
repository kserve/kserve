Read
[the section on segmentation](https://tensorflow.org/api_guides/python/math_ops#Segmentation)
for an explanation of segments.

Computes a tensor such that
\\(output_i = \prod_j data_j\\) where the product is over `j` such
that `segment_ids[j] == i`.

If the product is empty for a given segment ID `i`, `output[i] = 1`.
