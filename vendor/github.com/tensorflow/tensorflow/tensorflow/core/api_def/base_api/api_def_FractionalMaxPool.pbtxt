Pooling ratio for each dimension of `value`, currently only
supports row and col dimension and should be >= 1.0. For example, a valid
pooling ratio looks like [1.0, 1.44, 1.73, 1.0]. The first and last elements
must be 1.0 because we don't allow pooling on batch and channels
dimensions. 1.44 and 1.73 are pooling ratio on height and width dimensions
respectively.

When set to True, it means when pooling, the values at the boundary
of adjacent pooling cells are used by both cells. For example:

`index  0  1  2  3  4`

`value  20 5  16 3  7`

If the pooling sequence is [0, 2, 4], then 16, at index 2 will be used twice.
The result would be [20, 16] for fractional max pooling.

  summary: "Performs fractional max pooling on the input."
  description: <<END
Fractional max pooling is slightly different than regular max pooling.  In
regular max pooling, you downsize an input set by taking the maximum value of
smaller N x N subsections of the set (often 2x2), and try to reduce the set by
a factor of N, where N is an integer.  Fractional max pooling, as you might
expect from the word "fractional", means that the overall reduction ratio N
does not have to be an integer.

The sizes of the pooling regions are generated randomly but are fairly uniform.
For example, let's look at the height dimension, and the constraints on the
list of rows that will be pool boundaries.

First we define the following:

1.  input_row_length : the number of rows from the input set
2.  output_row_length : which will be smaller than the input
3.  alpha = input_row_length / output_row_length : our reduction ratio
4.  K = floor(alpha)
5.  row_pooling_sequence : this is the result list of pool boundary rows

Then, row_pooling_sequence should satisfy:

1.  a[0] = 0 : the first value of the sequence is 0
2.  a[end] = input_row_length : the last value of the sequence is the size
3.  K <= (a[i+1] - a[i]) <= K+1 : all intervals are K or K+1 size
4.  length(row_pooling_sequence) = output_row_length+1
