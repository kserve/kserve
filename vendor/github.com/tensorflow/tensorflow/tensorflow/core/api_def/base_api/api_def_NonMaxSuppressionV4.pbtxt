  summary: "Greedily selects a subset of bounding boxes in descending order of score,"
  description: <<END
pruning away boxes that have high intersection-over-union (IOU) overlap
with previously selected boxes.  Bounding boxes with score less than
`score_threshold` are removed.  Bounding boxes are supplied as
[y1, x1, y2, x2], where (y1, x1) and (y2, x2) are the coordinates of any
diagonal pair of box corners and the coordinates can be provided as normalized
(i.e., lying in the interval [0, 1]) or absolute.  Note that this algorithm
is agnostic to where the origin is in the coordinate system and more
generally is invariant to orthogonal transformations and translations
of the coordinate system; thus translating or reflections of the coordinate
system result in the same boxes being selected by the algorithm.
The output of this operation is a set of integers indexing into the input
collection of bounding boxes representing the selected boxes.  The bounding
box coordinates corresponding to the selected indices can then be obtained
using the `tf.gather operation`.  For example:
  selected_indices = tf.image.non_max_suppression_v2(
      boxes, scores, max_output_size, iou_threshold, score_threshold)
  selected_boxes = tf.gather(boxes, selected_indices)
