  summary: "Elementwise computes the bitwise right-shift of `x` and `y`."
  description: <<END
Performs a logical shift for unsigned integer types, and an arithmetic shift
for signed integer types.

If `y` is negative, or greater than or equal to than the width of `x` in bits
the result is implementation defined.
