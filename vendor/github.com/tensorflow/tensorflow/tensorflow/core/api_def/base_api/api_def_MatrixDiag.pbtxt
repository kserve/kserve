  summary: "Returns a batched diagonal tensor with a given batched diagonal values."
  description: <<END
Given a `diagonal`, this operation returns a tensor with the `diagonal` and
everything else padded with zeros. The diagonal is computed as follows:

Assume `diagonal` has `k` dimensions `[I, J, K, ..., N]`, then the output is a
tensor of rank `k+1` with dimensions [I, J, K, ..., N, N]` where:

`output[i, j, k, ..., m, n] = 1{m=n} * diagonal[i, j, k, ..., n]`.

For example:

```
# 'diagonal' is [[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8]]

and diagonal.shape = (2, 4)

tf.matrix_diag(diagonal) ==> [[[1, 0, 0, 0]
                                     [0, 2, 0, 0]
                                     [0, 0, 3, 0]
                                     [0, 0, 0, 4]],
                                    [[5, 0, 0, 0]
                                     [0, 6, 0, 0]
                                     [0, 0, 7, 0]
                                     [0, 0, 0, 8]]]

which has shape (2, 4, 4)
```
