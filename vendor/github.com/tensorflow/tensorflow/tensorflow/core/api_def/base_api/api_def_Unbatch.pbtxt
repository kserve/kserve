op {
  graph_op_name: "Unbatch"
  summary: "Reverses the operation of Batch for a single output Tensor."
  description: <<END
An instance of Unbatch either receives an empty batched_tensor, in which case it
asynchronously waits until the values become available from a concurrently
running instance of Unbatch with the same container and shared_name, or receives
a non-empty batched_tensor in which case it finalizes all other concurrently
running instances and outputs its own element from the batch.

batched_tensor: The possibly transformed output of Batch. The size of the first
 dimension should remain unchanged by the transformations for the operation to
 work.
batch_index: The matching batch_index obtained from Batch.
id: The id scalar emitted by Batch.
unbatched_tensor: The Tensor corresponding to this execution.
timeout_micros: Maximum amount of time (in microseconds) to wait to receive the
 batched input tensor associated with a given invocation of the op.
container: Container to control resource sharing.
shared_name: Instances of Unbatch with the same container and shared_name are
 assumed to possibly belong to the same batch. If left empty, the op name will
 be used as the shared name.
