  summary: "Computes the complex absolute value of a tensor."
  description: <<END
Given a tensor `x` of complex numbers, this operation returns a tensor of type
`float` or `double` that is the absolute value of each element in `x`. All
elements in `x` must be complex numbers of the form \\(a + bj\\). The absolute
value is computed as \\( \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\\).
