  summary: "Computes the sum along sparse segments of a tensor divided by the sqrt of N."
  description: <<END
N is the size of the segment being reduced.

Like `SparseSegmentSqrtN`, but allows missing ids in `segment_ids`. If an id is
misisng, the `output` tensor at that position will be zeroed.

for an explanation of segments.
