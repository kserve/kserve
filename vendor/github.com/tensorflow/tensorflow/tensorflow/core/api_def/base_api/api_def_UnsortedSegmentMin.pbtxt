[the section on segmentation](https://tensorflow.org/api_guides/python/math_ops#segmentation)
for an explanation of segments.

This operator is similar to the unsorted segment sum operator found
[(here)](../../../api_docs/python/math_ops.md#UnsortedSegmentSum).
Instead of computing the sum over segments, it computes the minimum such that:

\\(output_i = \min_{j...} data_[j...]\\) where min is over tuples `j...` such
that `segment_ids[j...] == i`.

If the minimum is empty for a given segment ID `i`, it outputs the largest
possible value for the specific numeric type,
`output[i] = numeric_limits<T>::max()`.

If the given segment ID `i` is negative, then the corresponding value is
dropped, and will not be included in the result.
