  summary: "Dequeues a tuple of one or more tensors from the given queue."
  description: <<END
This operation has k outputs, where k is the number of components
in the tuples stored in the given queue, and output i is the ith
component of the dequeued tuple.

N.B. If the queue is empty, this operation will block until an element
has been dequeued (or 'timeout_ms' elapses, if specified).
