  summary: "Computes the power of one value to another."
  description: <<END
Given a tensor `x` and a tensor `y`, this operation computes \\(x^y\\) for
corresponding elements in `x` and `y`. For example:

```
# tensor 'x' is [[2, 2]], [3, 3]]
# tensor 'y' is [[8, 16], [2, 3]]
tf.pow(x, y) ==> [[256, 65536], [9, 27]]
```
END
