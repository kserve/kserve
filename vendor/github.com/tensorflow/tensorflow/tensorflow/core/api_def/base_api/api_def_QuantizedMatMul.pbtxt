  summary: "Perform a quantized matrix multiplication of  `a` by the matrix `b`."
  description: <<END
The inputs must be two-dimensional matrices and the inner dimension of
`a` (after being transposed if `transpose_a` is non-zero) must match the
outer dimension of `b` (after being transposed if `transposed_b` is
non-zero).
