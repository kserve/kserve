  summary: "Outputs deterministic pseudorandom values from a truncated normal distribution."
  description: <<END
The generated values follow a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard
deviation 1, except that values whose magnitude is more than 2 standard
deviations from the mean are dropped and re-picked.

The outputs are a deterministic function of `shape` and `seed`.
