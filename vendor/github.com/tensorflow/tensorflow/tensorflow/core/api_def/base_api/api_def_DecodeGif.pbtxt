  summary: "Decode the first frame of a GIF-encoded image to a uint8 tensor."
  description: <<END
GIF with frame or transparency compression are not supported
convert animated GIF from compressed to uncompressed by:

    convert $src.gif -coalesce $dst.gif

This op also supports decoding JPEGs and PNGs, though it is cleaner to use
`tf.image.decode_image`.
