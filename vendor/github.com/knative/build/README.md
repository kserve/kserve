This repository contains a work-in-progress build system that is designed to
address a common need for cloud native development.

A Knative build extends
[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/)
and utilizes existing Kubernetes primitives to provide you with the ability to
run on-cluster container builds from source. For example, you can write a build
that uses Kubernetes-native resources to obtain your source code from a
repository, build a container image, then run that image.

While Knative builds are optimized for building, testing, and deploying source
code, you are still responsible for developing the corresponding components
that:

- Retrieve source code from repositories.
- Run multiple sequential jobs against a shared filesystem, for example:
  - Install dependencies.
  - Run unit and integration tests.
- Build container images.
- Push container images to an image registry, or deploy them to a cluster.

The goal of a Knative build is to provide a standard, portable, reusable, and
performance optimized method for defining and running on-cluster container image
builds. By providing the “boring but difficult” task of running builds on
Kubernetes, Knative saves you from having to independently develop and reproduce
these common Kubernetes-based development processes.

While today, a Knative build does not provide a complete standalone CI/CD
solution, it does however, provide a lower-level building block that was
purposefully designed to enable integration and utilization in larger systems.
