# Development

This doc explains how to setup a development environment so you can get started
[contributing](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Getting Started

1. [Check out the repository](#checking-out-the-repository)
1. [Run the controller (ko)](#running-the-controller-ko)
1. [Running integration tests](#running-integration-tests)

## Checking out the repository

To set the paths of the imports right, make sure you clone into the directory
`${GOPATH}/src/github.com/knative/build`. For example:

```shell
# Set up GOPATH
$ export GOPATH=$(pwd)/go  # Choose your directory.
$ mkdir -p ${GOPATH}

# Grab the repo itself.
$ go get github.com/knative/build
$ cd ${GOPATH}/src/github.com/knative/build

# Optionally add your remote.
$ git remote add ${USER} https://github.com/${USER}/build
```

## Running the Controller (ko)

### One-time setup

Configure `ko` to point to your registry:

For a gcr.io project (like "myproject"), it will need to have Container Registry
API enabled first.

```shell
# You can put these definitions in .bashrc, so this is one-time setup.
#
# KO_DOCKER_REPO is the image repository where the images for build
# will be pushed, including hostname.
export KO_DOCKER_REPO=us.gcr.io/<myproject>
```

**Note**: if you are using docker hub to store your images your `KO_DOCKER_REPO`
variable should be `docker.io/<username>`.

**Note**: Currently Docker Hub doesn't let you create subdirs under your
username.

For a local registry (using insecure `http://`) it needs to be on localhost:

```shell
docker run -it -d -p 5000:5000 registry:2
export KO_DOCKER_REPO=localhost:5000/<myproject>
```

Then ensure `ko` is set up:

```shell
# Install the "ko" cli
go get -u github.com/google/ko/cmd/ko

# Check that "ko" is on your path
which ko
```

Note that this expects your Docker authorization is
[properly configured](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/advanced-authentication#standalone_docker_credential_helper).

### Standing it up

You can stand up a version of this controller on-cluster with:

```shell
# This will register the CRD and deploy the controller to start acting on them.
ko apply -f config/
```

**NOTE:** This will deploy to `kubectl config current-context`.

### Iterating

As you make changes to the code, you can redeploy your controller with:

```shell
ko apply -f config/controller.yaml
```

**Two things of note:**

1. If your (external) dependencies have changed, you should:
   `./hack/update-deps.sh`.
1. If your type definitions have changed, you should:
   `./hack/update-codegen.sh`.

### Cleanup

You can clean up everything with:

```shell
ko delete -f config/
```

## Running Integration Tests

To run integration tests, run the following steps:

```shell
# First, have the version of the system that you want to test up.
# e.g. to change between builders, alter the flag in controller.yaml
ko apply -f config/

# Next, make sure that you have no builds or build templates in your current namespace:
kubectl delete builds --all
kubectl delete buildtemplates --all
kubectl delete clusterbuildtemplates --all

# Launch the test suite (this can be cleaned up with "ko delete -R -f test/")
ko apply -R -f test/
```

You can track the progress of your builds with this command, which will also
format the output nicely.

```shell
$ kubectl get builds -o=custom-columns-file=./test/columns.txt
NAME                             TYPE        STATUS    START                  END
test-custom-env-vars             Succeeded   True      2018-01-26T02:36:00Z   2018-01-26T02:36:02Z
test-custom-volume               Succeeded   True      2018-01-26T02:36:07Z   2018-01-26T02:36:10Z

test-home-volume                 Succeeded   True      2018-01-26T02:36:06Z   2018-01-26T02:36:10Z
test-template-duplicate-volume   Invalid     True      <nil>                  <nil>
test-template-volume             Succeeded   True      2018-01-26T02:36:08Z   2018-01-26T02:36:12Z
test-workingdir                  Succeeded   True      2018-01-26T02:36:04Z   2018-01-26T02:36:08Z
test-workspace-volume            Succeeded   True      2018-01-26T02:36:05Z   2018-01-26T02:36:09Z

```

The suite contains a mix of tests that are expected to end in `complete`,
`failed` and `invalid` states, and they are labeled with their expected
end-state, which you can feed into a label selector:

```shell
$ kubectl get builds -o=custom-columns-file=./test/columns.txt -l expect=invalid
NAME                             TYPE      STATUS    START     END
test-template-duplicate-volume   Invalid   True      <nil>     <nil>

$ kubectl get builds -o=custom-columns-file=./test/columns.txt -l expect=succeeded
NAME                      TYPE       STATUS    START                  END
test-custom-env-vars      Succeeded  True      2018-01-26T02:36:00Z   2018-01-26T02:36:02Z
test-custom-volume        Succeeded  True      2018-01-26T02:36:07Z   2018-01-26T02:36:10Z
test-default-workingdir   Succeeded  True      2018-01-26T02:36:02Z   2018-01-26T02:36:12Z
test-home-is-set          Succeeded  True      2018-01-26T02:35:58Z   2018-01-26T02:36:01Z
test-home-volume          Succeeded  True      2018-01-26T02:36:06Z   2018-01-26T02:36:10Z
test-template-volume      Succeeded  True      2018-01-26T02:36:08Z   2018-01-26T02:36:12Z
test-workingdir           Succeeded  True      2018-01-26T02:36:04Z   2018-01-26T02:36:08Z
test-workspace-volume     Succeeded  True      2018-01-26T02:36:05Z   2018-01-26T02:36:09Z
