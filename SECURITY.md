## Reporting a Vulnerability

We strongly encourage you to report security vulnerabilities to
our private security mailing list: kserve-security@lists.lfaidata.foundation - first, before
disclosing them in any public forums.

This is a private mailing list where only active maintainers of the project are allowed to be the members of the group and receive reported
security vulnerabilities, and the issues are treated as top priority.
