# Each entry in this list must resolve to an existing
# resource definition in YAML.  These are the resource
# files that kustomize reads, modifies and emits as a
# YAML string, with resources separated by document
# markers ("---").
resources:
- serving_v1alpha2_kfservice.yaml

patches:
  # Knative uses VolatileTime in place of metav1.Time to exclude this from creating equality.Semantic difference,
  # however when generating crd last transition time is tagged as object thus getting validation error while updating
  # status object(status.conditions.lastTransitionTime in body must be of type object: "string").
  # Controller-runtime 2.0 supports +kubebuilder:validation:Type=string but we are still on 1.9.0 due to knative dep.
