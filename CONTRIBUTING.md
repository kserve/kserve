# How to Contribute

We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project. There are
just a few small guidelines you need to follow.


## Code reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult
[GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more
information on using pull requests.

The following should be viewed as Best Practices unless you know better ones (please submit a guidelines PR).

| Practice | Rationale |
| -------- | --------- |
| Keep the code clean | The health of the codebase is imperative to the success of the project. Files should be under 500 lines long in most cases, which may mean a refactor is necessary before adding changes. |
| Limit your scope | No one wants to review a 1000 line PR. Try to keep your changes focused to ease reviewability. This may mean separating a large feature into several smaller milestones.  |
| Refine commit messages | Your commit messages should be in the imperative tense and clearly describe your feature upon first glance. See [this article](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) for guidelines.
| Reference an issue | Issues are a great way to gather design feedback from the community. To save yourself time on a controversial PR, first cut an issue for any major feature work. |
