# Predict on a InferenceService using a Custom Torchserve Image

In this example we use torchserve as custom server to serve an mnist model. The idea of using torchserve as custom server is to make the transistion for new users from torchserve to kfserving easier.

## Setup

1. Your ~/.kube/config should point to a cluster with [KFServing installed](https://github.com/kubeflow/kfserving/#install-kfserving).
2. Your cluster's Istio Ingress gateway must be [network accessible](https://istio.io/latest/docs/tasks/traffic-management/ingress/ingress-control/).

### This example requires v1beta1/KFS 0.5

## Build and push the sample Docker Image

The custom torchserve image is wrapped with model inside the container and serves it with KFServing.

In this example we build a torchserve image with marfile and config.properties into a container. To build and push with Docker Hub, run these commands replacing {username} with your Docker Hub username:

Refer steps for [building and publishing](./torchserve-image/README.md) docker image.

## Create the InferenceService

In the `torchserve-custom.yaml` file edit the container image and replace {username} with your Docker Hub username.

Apply the CRD

```bash
kubectl apply -f torchserve-custom.yaml
```

Expected Output

```bash
$inferenceservice.serving.kubeflow.org/torchserve-custom created
```

## Run a prediction

The first step is to [determine the ingress IP and ports](../../../../../README.md#determine-the-ingress-ip-and-ports) and set `INGRESS_HOST` and `INGRESS_PORT`

Download input image:

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pytorch/serve/master/examples/image_classifier/mnist/test_data/0.png

```bash
MODEL_NAME=torchserve-custom
SERVICE_HOSTNAME=$(kubectl get inferenceservice ${MODEL_NAME} -n <namespace> -o jsonpath='{.status.url}' | cut -d "/" -f 3)

curl -v -H "Host: ${SERVICE_HOSTNAME}" http://${INGRESS_HOST}:${INGRESS_PORT}/predictions/mnist -T 0.png
```

Expected Output

```bash
