# Example Anchors Text Explaination for Movie Sentiment

This example uses a [movie sentiment dataset](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/pabo/movie-review-data/).

For a more visual rethrough please try the [Jupyter notebook](movie_review_explanations.ipynb).

We can create a InferenceService with a trained sklearn predictor for this dataset and an associated explainer. The black box explainer algorithm we will use is the Text version of Anchors from the [Alibi open source library](https://github.com/SeldonIO/alibi). More details on this algorithm and configuration settings that can be set can be found in the [Seldon Alibi documentation](https://docs.seldon.io/projects/alibi/en/stable/).

The InferenceService is shown below:

```
apiVersion: "serving.kubeflow.org/v1alpha2"
kind: "InferenceService"
metadata:
  name: "moviesentiment"
spec:
  default:
    predictor:
      minReplicas: 1
      sklearn:
        storageUri: "gs://seldon-models/sklearn/moviesentiment"
        resources:
          requests:
            cpu: 0.1
            memory: 1Gi                        
          limits:
            cpu: 1
            memory: 1Gi                        
    explainer:
      minReplicas: 1
      alibi:
        type: AnchorText
        resources:
          requests:
            cpu: 0.1
            memory: 6Gi            
          limits:
            memory: 6Gi
        
```

Create this InferenceService:

```
kubectl create -f moviesentiment.yaml
```

Set up some environment variables for the model name and cluster entrypoint.

```
MODEL_NAME=moviesentiment
INGRESS_GATEWAY=istio-ingressgateway
CLUSTER_IP=$(kubectl -n istio-system get service $INGRESS_GATEWAY -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}')
```

Test the predictor on an example sentence:

```
curl -H "Host: ${MODEL_NAME}.default.example.com" http://$CLUSTER_IP/v1/models/$MODEL_NAME:predict -d '{"instances":["a visually flashy but narratively opaque and emotionally vapid exercise ."]}'
```

You should receive the response showing negative sentiment:

```
{"predictions": [0]}
```

Test on another sentence:

```
curl -H "Host: ${MODEL_NAME}.default.example.com" http://$CLUSTER_IP/v1/models/$MODEL_NAME:predict -d '{"instances":["a touching , sophisticated film that almost seems like a documentary in the way it captures an italian immigrant family on the brink of major changes ."]}'
```

You should receive the response showing positive sentiment:

```
{"predictions": [1]}
```

Now lets get an explanation for the first sentence:


```
curl -v -H "Host: ${MODEL_NAME}.default.example.com" http://$CLUSTER_IP/v1/models/$MODEL_NAME:explain -d '{"instances":["a visually flashy but narratively opaque and emotionally vapid exercise ."]}'
```

The returned explanation will be like:

```

}

```

This shows the key word "bad" was indetified and examples show it in context using the default "UKN" placeholder for surrounding words.


## Custom Configuration

You can add custom configuration for the Anchor Text explainer in the 'config' section. For example we can change the text explainer to sample from the corpus rather than use UKN placeholders:

```
apiVersion: "serving.kubeflow.org/v1alpha2"
kind: "InferenceService"
metadata:
  name: "moviesentiment"
spec:
  default:
    predictor:
      sklearn:
        storageUri: "gs://seldon-models/sklearn/moviesentiment"
        resources:
          requests:
            cpu: 0.1
    explainer:
      alibi:
        type: AnchorText
        config:
          use_unk: "false"
          sample_proba: "0.5"	  
        resources:
          requests:
            cpu: 0.1
```

If we apply this:

```
kubectl create -f moviesentiment2.yaml
```

and then ask for an explanation:

```
curl -H "Host: ${MODEL_NAME}.default.example.com" http://$CLUSTER_IP/v1/models/$MODEL_NAME:explain -d '{"instances":["a visually flashy but narratively opaque and emotionally vapid exercise ."]}'
```

The explanation would be like:

```

## Local Testing

If you wish to test locally first install the requirements:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now train the model:

```
make train
```

You can then store the `model.joblib` in a bucket accessible from your Kubernetes cluster.
