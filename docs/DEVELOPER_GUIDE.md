# Development

This doc explains how to setup a development environment so you can get started
[contributing](../CONTRIBUTING.md)
to `kfserving`. Also take a look at:

- [How to add and run tests](../test/README.md)
- [Iterating](#iterating)

## Prerequisites

Follow the instructions below to set up your development environment. Once you
meet these requirements, you can make changes and
[deploy your own version of kfserving](#deploy-kfserving)!

Before submitting a PR, see also [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Install requirements

You must install these tools:

1. [`go`](https://golang.org/doc/install): KFServing controller is written in Go.
1. [`git`](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/): For source control.
1. [`dep`](https://github.com/golang/dep): For managing external Go
   dependencies. You should install `dep` using their `install.sh`.
1. [`ko`](https://github.com/google/ko):
   For development.
1. [`kubectl`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/): For
   managing development environments.
1. [`kustomize`](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/) To customize YAMLs for different environments

### Install Knative on a Kubernetes cluster

KFServing currently requires `Knative Serving` for auto-scaling, canary rollout, `Istio` for traffic routing and ingress.

* You can follow the instructions on [Set up a kubernetes cluster and install Knative Serving](https://knative.dev/docs/install/) or
[Custom Install](https://knative.dev/docs/install/knative-custom-install) to install `Istio` and `Knative Serving`. Observability plug-ins are good to have for monitoring.

* If you already have `Istio` (e.g. from a Kubeflow install) then simply skip the `Istio` steps. For Kubeflow install, you can install `Knative Serving` v0.8 via
the following commands after downloading repository [kubeflow/manifests](https://github.com/kubeflow/manifests).

  ``` kubeflow/manifests/knative/knative-serving-crds/base$ kustomize build . | kubectl apply -f -```

  ``` kubeflow/manifests/knative/knative-serving-install/base$ kustomize build . | kubectl apply -f -```

* You need follow the instructions on [Updating your install to use cluster local gateway](https://knative.dev/v0.9-docs/install/installing-istio/#updating-your-install-to-use-cluster-local-gateway) to add cluster local gateway to your cluster if you are on knative serving 0.9.0+.

### Setup your environment

To start your environment you'll need to set these environment variables (we
recommend adding them to your `.bashrc`):

1. `GOPATH`: If you don't have one, simply pick a directory and add
   `export GOPATH=...`
1. `$GOPATH/bin` on `PATH`: This is so that tooling installed via `go get` will
   work properly.
1. `KO_DOCKER_REPO`: The docker repository to which developer images should be
   pushed (e.g. `docker.io/<username>/[project]`).

- **Note**: Set up a docker repository for pushing images. You can use any container image registry by adjusting 
the authentication methods and repository paths mentioned in the sections below.
   - [Google Container Registry quickstart](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/pushing-and-pulling)
   - [Docker Hub quickstart](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/)
   - [Azure Container Registry quickstart](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-registry/container-registry-get-started-portal)
- **Note**: if you are using docker hub to store your images your
  `KO_DOCKER_REPO` variable should be `docker.io/<username>`.
- **Note**: Currently Docker Hub doesn't let you create subdirs under your
  username.

`.bashrc` example:

```shell
export GOPATH="$HOME/go"
export PATH="${PATH}:${GOPATH}/bin"
export KO_DOCKER_REPO='docker.io/<username>'
```

### Checkout your fork

The Go tools require that you clone the repository to the
`src/github.com/kubeflow/kfserving` directory in your
[`GOPATH`](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/SettingGOPATH).

To check out this repository:

1. Create your own
   [fork of this repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)
1. Clone it to your machine:

```shell
mkdir -p ${GOPATH}/src/github.com/kubeflow
cd ${GOPATH}/src/github.com/kubeflow
git clone git@github.com:${YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME}/kfserving.git
cd kfserving
git remote add upstream git@github.com:kubeflow/kfserving.git
git remote set-url --push upstream no_push
```

_Adding the `upstream` remote sets you up nicely for regularly
[syncing your fork](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/)._

Once you reach this point you are ready to do a full build and deploy as
described below.

## Deploy KFServing

### Check Knative Serving installation
Once you've [setup your development environment](#prerequisites), you can see things running with:

```console
$ kubectl -n knative-serving get pods
NAME                          READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
activator-c8495dc9-z7xpz      2/2       Running   0          6d
autoscaler-66897845df-t5cwg   2/2       Running   0          6d
controller-699fb46bb5-xhlkg   1/1       Running   0          6d
webhook-76b87b8459-tzj6r      1/1       Running   0          6d
```
### Deploy KFServing from default

```bash
make deploy
```

After above step you can see things running with:
```console
$ kubectl get pods -n kfserving-system -l control-plane=kfserving-controller-manager
NAME                             READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
kfserving-controller-manager-0   2/2     Running   0          13m
```
- **Note**: By default it installs to `kfserving-system` namespace with the published
`kfserving-controller-manager` image.

### Deploy KFServing with your own version
```bash
make deploy-dev
```
- **Note**: `deploy-dev` builds the image from your local code, publishes to `KO_DOCKER_REPO`
and deploys the `kfserving-controller-manager` with the image digest to your cluster for testing. Please also ensure you are logged in to `KO_DOCKER_REPO` from your client machine.


### Smoke test after deployment
```bash
kubectl apply -f docs/samples/tensorflow/tensorflow.yaml
```
You should see model serving deployment running under default or your specified namespace.

```console
$ kubectl get inferenceservices -n default
NAME             READY     URL                                  DEFAULT TRAFFIC   CANARY TRAFFIC   AGE
flowers-sample   True      flowers-sample.default.example.com   100                                1h

$ kubectl get pods -n default -l serving.kubeflow.org/inferenceservice=flowers-sample
NAME                                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
flowers-sample-default-htz8r-deployment-8fd979f9b-w2qbv   3/3     Running   0          10s
```
NOTE: KFServing scales pods to 0 in the absence of traffic. If you don't see any pods, try sending out a query via curl using instructions in the tensorflow sample: https://github.com/kubeflow/kfserving/tree/master/docs/samples/tensorflow


## Iterating

As you make changes to the code-base, there are two special cases to be aware
of:

- **If you change an input to generated code**, then you must run
  `make manifests`. Inputs include:

  - API type definitions in
    [pkg/apis/serving/v1alpha2/](../pkg/apis/serving/v1alpha2/.),
  - Manifests or kustomize patches stored in [config](../config).

- **If you change a package's deps** (including adding external dep), then you
  must run `dep ensure`. Dependency changes should be a separate commit and not
  mixed with logic changes.

These are both idempotent, and we expect that running these at `HEAD` to have no
diffs. Code generation and dependencies are automatically checked to produce no
diffs for each pull request.

In some cases, if newer dependencies
are required, you need to run "dep ensure -update package-name" manually.

Once the codegen and dependency information is correct, redeploying the
controller is simply:

```shell
make deploy-dev
```

### Knative CLI (knctl):

You can also use [Knative CLI (`knctl`)](https://github.com/cppforlife/knctl) to interact with models deployed on KFServing. It provides a simple set of commands to interact with a [Knative installation](https://github.com/knative/docs). You can grab pre-built binaries from the [Releases page](https://github.com/cppforlife/knctl/releases). Once downloaded, you can run the following commands to get it working.

```
# compare checksum output to what's included in the release notes
$ shasum -a 265 ~/Downloads/knctl-*

# move binary to your systemâ€™s /usr/local/bin -- might require root password
$ mv ~/Downloads/knctl-* /usr/local/bin/knctl

# make the newly copied file executable -- might require root password
$ chmod +x /usr/local/bin/knctl
```

You can then run a smoke test by running the following command to show the details of tensorflow sample revision.

```
knctl revision show -r flowers-sample-default-4s74r
Revision 'flowers-sample-default-4s74r'

## Troubleshooting

1. If you are on kubernetes 1.15+, we highly recommend adding object selector on kfserving pod mutating webhook configuration so that only pods managed by kfserving go through the kfserving pod mutator

```
kubectl patch mutatingwebhookconfiguration inferenceservice.serving.kubeflow.org --patch '{"webhooks":[{"name": "inferenceservice.kfserving-webhook-server.pod-mutator","objectSelector":{"matchExpressions":[{"key":"serving.kubeflow.org/inferenceservice", "operator": "Exists"}]}}]}'
```

2. When you run make deploy, you may encounter an error like this:

```shell
error: error validating "STDIN": error validating data: ValidationError(CustomResourceDefinition.spec.validation.openAPIV3Schema.properties.status.properties.conditions.properties.conditions.items): invalid type for io.k8s.apiextensions-apiserver.pkg.apis.apiextensions.v1beta1.JSONSchemaPropsOrArray: got "map", expected ""; if you choose to ignore these errors, turn validation off with --validate=false
make: *** [deploy] Error 1
```

To fix it, please ensure you have a matching version of kubectl client as the master. If not, please update accordingly.

```shell
kubectl version
Client Version: version.Info{Major:"1", Minor:"13", GitVersion:"v1.13.6", GitCommit:"abdda3f9fefa29172298a2e42f5102e777a8ec25", GitTreeState:"clean", BuildDate:"2019-05-08T13:53:53Z", GoVersion:"go1.11.5", Compiler:"gc", Platform:"darwin/amd64"}
Server Version: version.Info{Major:"1", Minor:"13", GitVersion:"v1.13.6+IKS", GitCommit:"ac5f7341d5d0ce8ea8f206ba5b030dc9e9d4cc97", GitTreeState:"clean", BuildDate:"2019-05-09T13:26:51Z", GoVersion:"go1.11.5", Compiler:"gc", Platform:"linux/amd64"}
```

3. When you run make deploy-dev, you may see an error like the one below:

```shell
2019/05/17 15:13:54 error processing import paths in "config/default/manager/manager.yaml": unsupported status code 401; body: 
kustomize build config/overlays/development | kubectl apply -f -
Error: reading strategic merge patches [manager_image_patch.yaml]: evalsymlink failure on '/Users/animeshsingh/go/src/github.com/kubeflow/kfserving/config/overlays/development/manager_image_patch.yaml' : lstat /Users/animeshsingh/go/src/github.com/kubeflow/kfserving/config/overlays/development/manager_image_patch.yaml: no such file or directory
```

It`s a red herring. To resolve it, please ensure you have logged into dockerhub from you client machine.

4. When you deploy the tensorflow sample, you may encounter an error like the one blow:

```
2019-09-28 01:52:23.345692: E tensorflow_serving/sources/storage_path/file_system_storage_path_source.cc:362] FileSystemStoragePathSource encountered a filesystem access error: Could not find base path /mnt/models for servable flowers-sample
```

Please make sure not to deploy the inferenceservice in the `kfserving-system` or other namespaces where namespace has  `control-plane` as a label. The `storage-initializer` init container does not get injected for deployments in those namespaces since they do not go through the mutating webhook.

5. You may get one of the following errors after 'make deploy-dev', and while deploying the sample model

```shell
kubectl apply -f docs/samples/tensorflow/tensorflow.yaml
Error from server (InternalError): error when creating "docs/samples/tensorflow/tensorflow.yaml": 
Internal error occurred: failed calling webhook "inferenceservice.kfserving-webhook-server.defaulter": 
Post https://kfserving-webhook-server-service.kfserving-system.svc:443/mutate-inferenceservices?timeout=30s:
```

```shell
 context deadline exceeded
```

```shell
unexpected EOF
```

```shell
dial tcp x.x.x.x:443: connect: connection refused
```

If above errors appear, first thing to check is if the KFServing controller is running

```shell
kubectl get po -n kfserving-system
NAME                             READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
kfserving-controller-manager-0   2/2     Running   2          13m
```

If it is, more often than not, it is caused by a stale webhook, since webhooks are immutable. Please delete them, and test again

```shell
kubectl delete mutatingwebhookconfigurations inferenceservice.serving.kubeflow.org &&  kubectl delete validatingwebhookconfigurations inferenceservice.serving.kubeflow.org && kubectl delete po kfserving-controller-manager-0  -n kfserving-system

mutatingwebhookconfiguration.admissionregistration.k8s.io "inferenceservice.serving.kubeflow.org" deleted
validatingwebhookconfiguration.admissionregistration.k8s.io "inferenceservice.serving.kubeflow.org" deleted
```
