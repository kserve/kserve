# Scikit-Learn Server

[Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) server is an implementation of KFServing for serving Scikit-learn models, and provides a Scikit-learn model implementation for prediction, pre and post processing. 

To start the server locally for development needs, run the following command under this folder in your github repository. 

```
pip install -e .
```

The following output indicates a successful install.

Once Scikit-learn server is up and running, you can check for successful installation by running the following command

```
python3 -m sklearnserver
usage: __main__.py [-h] [--http_port HTTP_PORT] [--grpc_port GRPC_PORT]
                   --model_dir MODEL_DIR [--model_name MODEL_NAME]
__main__.py: error: the following arguments are required: --model_dir
```

You can now point to your `joblib` model file and use the server to load the model and test for prediction. Models can be on local filesystem, S3 compatible object storage or Google Cloud Storage. Please follow [this sample](https://github.com/kubeflow/kfserving/tree/master/docs/samples/sklearn) to test your server by generating your own model.
