KServe is a standardized distributed generative and predictive AI inference platform for scalable, multi-framework deployment on Kubernetes.

KServe is being [used by many organizations](https://kserve.github.io/website/docs/community/adopters) and is a [Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)](https://www.cncf.io/) incubating project.

For more details, visit the [KServe website](https://kserve.github.io/website/).

### Why KServe?

Single platform that unifies Generative and Predictive AI inference on Kubernetes. Simple enough for quick deployments, yet powerful enough to handle enterprise-scale AI workloads with advanced features.

### Features

**Generative AI**
  * üß† **LLM-Optimized**: OpenAI-compatible inference protocol for seamless integration with large language models
  * üöÖ **GPU Acceleration**: High-performance serving with GPU support and optimized memory management for large models
  * üíæ **Model Caching**: Intelligent model caching to reduce loading times and improve response latency for frequently used models
  * üóÇÔ∏è **KV Cache Offloading**: Advanced memory management with KV cache offloading to CPU/disk for handling longer sequences efficiently
  * üìà **Autoscaling**: Request-based autoscaling capabilities optimized for generative workload patterns
  * üîß **Hugging Face Ready**: Native support for Hugging Face models with streamlined deployment workflows

**Predictive AI**
  * üßÆ **Multi-Framework**: Support for TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, XGBoost, ONNX, and more
  * üîÄ **Intelligent Routing**: Seamless request routing between predictor, transformer, and explainer components with automatic traffic management
  * üîÑ **Advanced Deployments**: Canary rollouts, inference pipelines, and ensembles with InferenceGraph
  * ‚ö° **Autoscaling**: Request-based autoscaling with scale-to-zero for predictive workloads
  * üîç **Model Explainability**: Built-in support for model explanations and feature attribution to understand prediction reasoning
  * üìä **Advanced Monitoring**: Enables payload logging, outlier detection, adversarial detection, and drift detection
  * üí∞ **Cost Efficient**: Scale-to-zero on expensive resources when not in use, reducing infrastructure costs

### :hammer_and_wrench: Installation

#### Standalone Installation
- **[Standard Kubernetes Installation](https://kserve.github.io/website/docs/admin-guide/overview#raw-kubernetes-deployment)**: Compared to Serverless Installation, this is a more **lightweight** installation. However, this option does not support canary deployment and request based autoscaling with scale-to-zero.
- **[Knative Installation](https://kserve.github.io/website/docs/admin-guide/overview#serverless-deployment)**: KServe by default installs Knative for **serverless deployment** for InferenceService.
- **[ModelMesh Installation](https://kserve.github.io/website/docs/admin-guide/overview#modelmesh-deployment)**: You can optionally install ModelMesh to enable **high-scale**, **high-density** and **frequently-changing model serving** use cases. 
- **[Quick Installation](https://kserve.github.io/website/docs/getting-started/quickstart-guide)**: Install KServe on your local machine.

#### Kubeflow Installation
KServe is an important addon component of Kubeflow, please learn more from the [Kubeflow KServe documentation](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/external-add-ons/kserve/kserve). Check out the following guides for running [on AWS](https://awslabs.github.io/kubeflow-manifests/main/docs/component-guides/kserve) or [on OpenShift Container Platform](https://github.com/kserve/kserve/blob/master/docs/OPENSHIFT_GUIDE.md).
