Multiple classification trees, for example, are commonly combined using a \"majority-vote\" method. Multiple regression trees are often combined using various averaging techniques. e.g tagging models with segment identifiers and weights to be used for their combination in these ways. ```yaml kind: InferenceGraph metadata:\n\n\tname: ensemble\n\nspec:\n\n\tnodes:\n\t  root:\n\t    routerType: Sequence\n\t    routes:\n\t    - service: feast\n\t    - nodeName: ensembleModel\n\t      data: $response\n\t  ensembleModel:\n\t    routerType: Ensemble\n\t    routes:\n\t    - service: sklearn-model\n\t    - service: xgboost-model\n\n```\n\nScoring a case using a sequence, or chain of models allows the output of one model to be passed in as input to the subsequent models. ```yaml kind: InferenceGraph metadata:\n\n\tname: model-chainer\n\nspec:\n\n\tnodes:\n\t  root:\n\t    routerType: Sequence\n\t    routes:\n\t    - service: mymodel-s1\n\t    - service: mymodel-s2\n\t      data: $response\n\t    - service: mymodel-s3\n\t      data: $response\n\n```\n\nIn the flow described below, the pre_processing node base64 encodes the image and passes it to two model nodes in the flow. The encoded data is available to both these nodes for classification. The second node i.e. dog-breed-classification takes the original input from the pre_processing node along-with the response from the cat-dog-classification node to do further classification of the dog breed if required. ```yaml kind: InferenceGraph metadata:\n\n\tname: dog-breed-classification\n\nspec:\n\n\tnodes:\n\t  root:\n\t    routerType: Sequence\n\t    routes:\n\t    - service: cat-dog-classifier\n\t    - nodeName: breed-classifier\n\t      data: $request\n\t  breed-classifier:\n\t    routerType: Switch\n\t    routes:\n\t    - service: dog-breed-classifier\n\t      condition: { .predictions.class == \"dog\" }\n\t    - service: cat-breed-classifier\n\t      condition: { .predictions.class == \"cat\" }\n\n```",
